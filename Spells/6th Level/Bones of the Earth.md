# Bones of the Earth

**Bones of the Earth**
_6th-level Transmutation_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 120 ft
**Components:** V S
**Duration:** Instantaneous
**Damage/Effect:** 6d6 Bludgeoning damage

*<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target the ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10-foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a [[/save dex format=long]] or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or [[/check dex format=long]] (the creature’s choice) against the spell’s save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">**<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">**At Higher Levels.**</span>** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can create two additional pillars for each slot level above 6th.</p>*
