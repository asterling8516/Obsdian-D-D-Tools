# Sunbeam

**Sunbeam**
_6th-level Evocation_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V S M (a magnifying glass)
**Duration:** 1 minute
**Damage/Effect:** 6d8 Radiant damage

*<p>You launch a sunbeam in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long Line. Each creature in the Line makes a [[/save con format=long]]. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 Radiant damage and has the Blinded condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only.

Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to create a new Line of radiance.

For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines above you. It sheds Bright Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.</p>*
