# Counterspell

**Counterspell**
_3rd-level Abjuration_
**Casting Time:** 1 reaction (which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of yourself casting a spell with Verbal, Somatic, or Material components)
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 60 ft
**Components:** S
**Duration:** Instantaneous
**Damage/Effect:** Effect

*You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. The creature makes a [[/save con format=long]]. On a failed save, the spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, Bonus Action, or Reaction used to cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot, the slot isnâ€™t expended.*
