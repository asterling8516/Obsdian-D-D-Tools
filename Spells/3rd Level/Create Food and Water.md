*You create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of fresh water on the ground or in containers within rangeâ€”both useful in fending off the hazards of malnutrition and dehydration. The food is bland but nourishing and looks like a food of your choice, and the water is clean. The food spoils after 24 hours if uneaten.*
