# Phantom Steed

**Phantom Steed**
_3rd-level Illusion_
**Casting Time:** 1 minute
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 30 ft
**Components:** V S
**Duration:** 1 hour
**Damage/Effect:** Damage

*<p>A Large, quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creatureâ€™s appearance, and it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The steed uses the Riding Horse stat block, except it has a Speed of 100 feet and can travel 13 miles in an hour. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends early if the steed takes any damage.</p>*
