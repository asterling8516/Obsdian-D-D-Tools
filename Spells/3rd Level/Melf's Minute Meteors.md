# Melf's Minute Meteors

**Melf's Minute Meteors**
_3rd-level Evocation_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V S M (niter, sulfur, and pine tar formed into a bead)
**Duration:** 10 minute
**Damage/Effect:** 2d6 Fire damage

*You create six tiny meteors in your space. They float in the air and orbit you for the spell’s duration. When you cast the spell — and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter — you can expend one or two of the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet of you. Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a [[/save dex format=long]]. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
<p class="s19">****At Higher Levels.**** <span class="p">When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.</span></p>*
