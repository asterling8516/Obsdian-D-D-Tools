# Call Lightning

**Call Lightning**
_3rd-level Conjuration_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 120 ft
**Components:** V S
**Duration:** 10 minute
**Damage/Effect:** 3d10 Lightning damage, 4d10 Lightning damage

*<p>A storm cloud appears at a point within range that you can see above yourself. It takes the shape of a Cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius.

When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A lightning bolt shoots from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point makes a [[/save dex format=long]], taking 3d10 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to call down lightning in that way again, targeting the same point or a different one.

If you’re outdoors in a storm when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over that storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell’s damage increases by 1d10.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 3.</p>*
