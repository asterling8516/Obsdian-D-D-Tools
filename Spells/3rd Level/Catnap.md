# Catnap

**Catnap**
_3rd-level Enchantment_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 30 ft
**Components:** S M (a pinch of sand)
**Duration:** 10 minute
**Damage/Effect:** Damage

*<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range fall unconscious for the spell’s duration. The spell ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. If a target remains unconscious for the full duration, that target gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can’t be affected by this spell again until it finishes a long rest.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">****At Higher Levels.**** </span>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional willing creature for each slot level above 3rd.</p>*
