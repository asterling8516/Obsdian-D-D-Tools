**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 90 ft
**Components:** V S M (a rotten egg)
**Duration:** 1 minute
**Damage/Effect:** Effect

*<p>You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud is Heavily Obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a strong wind (such as the one created by Gust of Wind) disperses it.

Each creature that starts its turn in the Sphere must succeed on a [[/save con format=long]] or have the Poisoned condition until the end of the current turn. While Poisoned in this way, the creature canâ€™t take an action or a Bonus Action.</p>*
