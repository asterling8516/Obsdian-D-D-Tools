# Slow

**Slow**
_3rd-level Transmutation_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** Save
**Range:** 120 ft
**Components:** V S M (a drop of molasses)
**Duration:** 1 minute
**Damage/Effect:** Effect

*<p>You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot Cube within range. Each target must succeed on a [[/save wis format=long]] or be affected by this spell for the duration.

An affected target’s Speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t take Reactions. On its turns, it can take either an action or a Bonus Action, not both, and it can make only one attack if it takes the Attack action. If it casts a spell with a Somatic component, there is a 25 percent chance the spell fails as a result of the target making the spell’s gestures too slowly.

An affected target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on itself on a success.</p>*
