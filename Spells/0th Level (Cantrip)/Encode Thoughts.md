# Encode Thoughts

**Encode Thoughts**
_Cantrip Enchantment_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** Self
**Components:** S
**Duration:** 8 hour
**Damage/Effect:** Effect

*<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">Putting a finger to your head, you pull a memory, an idea, or a message from your mind and transform it into a tangible string of glowing energy called a thought strand, which persists for the duration or until you cast this spell again. The thought strand appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a Tiny, weightless, semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon. It is otherwise stationary.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">If you cast this spell while concentrating on a spell or an ability that allows you to read or manipulate the thoughts of others (such as <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">detect thoughts</span> or <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">modify memory</span>), you can transform the thoughts or memories you read, rather than your own, into a thought strand.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">Casting this spell while holding a thought strand allows you to instantly receive whatever memory, idea, or message the thought strand contains. (Casting <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">detect thoughts</span> on the strand has the same effect.)</p>*
