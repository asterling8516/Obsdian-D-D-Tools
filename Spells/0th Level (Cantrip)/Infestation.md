*<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to appear momentarily on one creature you can see within range.

Roll a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn’t move.</p>
