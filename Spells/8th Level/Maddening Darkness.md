*<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with [[Darkvision]] can’t see through this darkness. Nonmagical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or lower, can’t illuminate the area.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere. Whenever a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it must make a [[/save wis format=long]], taking 8d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>*
