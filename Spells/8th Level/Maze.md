# Maze

**Maze**
_8th-level Conjuration_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 60 ft
**Components:** V S
**Duration:** 10 minute
**Damage/Effect:** Effect

*<p>You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.

The target can take a Study action to try to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends.

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.</p>*
