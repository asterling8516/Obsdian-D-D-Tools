# Compelled Duel

**Compelled Duel**
_1st-level Enchantment_
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus
**Attack/Save:** Save
**Range:** 30 ft
**Components:** V
**Duration:** 1 minute
**Damage/Effect:** Damage

*You attempt to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that you can see within range must make a [[/save wis format=long]]. On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand. For the duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a [[/save wis format=long]] each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this spell doesn’t restrict the target’s movement for that turn. <br /><br />The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.*
