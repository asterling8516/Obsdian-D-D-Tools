# Snare

**Snare**
_1st-level Abjuration_
**Casting Time:** 1 minute
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** S M (25 feet of rope, which the spell consumes)
**Duration:** 8 hour
**Damage/Effect:** Effect

*<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check against your spell save DC to be discerned.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spell’s radius. That creature must succeed on a [[/save dex format=long]] or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is restrained there until the spell ends.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">A restrained creature can make a [[/save dex format=long]] at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence ([[Arcana]]) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained effect ends.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is restrained by it.</p>*
