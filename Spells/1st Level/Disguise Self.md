# Disguise Self

**Disguise Self**
_1st-level Illusion_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V S
**Duration:** 1 hour
**Damage/Effect:** Effect

*<p>You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear heavier or lighter. You must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs as you have. Otherwise, the extent of the [[illusion]] is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature must take the Study action to inspect your appearance and succeed on an Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check against your spell save DC.</p>*
