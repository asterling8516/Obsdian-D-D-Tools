# Ensnaring Strike

**Ensnaring Strike**
_1st-level Conjuration_
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus (which you take immediately after hitting a creature with a weapon)
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V
**Duration:** 1 minute
**Damage/Effect:** 1d6 Piercing damage

*<p>As you hit the target, grasping vines appear on it, and it makes a [[/save str format=long]]. A Large or larger creature has Advantage on this save. On a failed save, the target has the Restrained condition until the spell ends. On a successful save, the vines shrivel away, and the spell ends.

While Restrained, the target takes 1d6 Piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. The target or a creature within reach of it can take an action to make a Strength ([[Athletics]]) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell ends.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.</p>*
