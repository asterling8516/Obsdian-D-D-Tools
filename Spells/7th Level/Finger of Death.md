_7th-level Necromancy_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 60 ft
**Components:** V S
**Duration:** Instantaneous
**Damage/Effect:** 7d8 Necrotic damage

*<p>You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a [[/save con format=long]]. It takes 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a zombie that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability.</p>*
