*<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">You choose a point within range and cause psychic energy to explode there. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make an [[/save int format=long]]. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower canâ€™t be affected by this spell. A target takes 8d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls a d6 and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. The target can make an [[/save int format=long]] at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>*
