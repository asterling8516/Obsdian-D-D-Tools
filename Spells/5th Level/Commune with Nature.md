*<p>You commune with [[nature]] spirits and gain knowledge of the surrounding area. In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the area within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn’t function where [[nature]] has been replaced by construction, such as in castles and settlements.

Choose three of the following facts; you learn those facts as they pertain to the spell’s area:</p>
* Locations of settlements
* Locations of portals to other planes of existence
* Location of one Challenge Rating 10+ creature (DM’s choice) that is a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, a Fiend, or an Undead
* The most prevalent kind of plant, mineral, or Beast (you choose which to learn)
* Locations of bodies of water

For example, you could determine the location of a powerful monster in the area, the locations of bodies of water, and the locations of any towns.*
