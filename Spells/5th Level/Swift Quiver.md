# Swift Quiver

**Swift Quiver**
_5th-level Transmutation_
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V S M (a quiver containing at least one piece of ammunition)
**Duration:** 1 minute
**Damage/Effect:** Effect

*You transmute your quiver so it produces an endless supply of nonmagical ammunition, which seems to leap into your hand when you reach for it.<br /><br />On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with a weapon that uses ammunition from the quiver. Each time you make such a ranged attack, your quiver magically replaces the piece of ammunition you used with a similar piece of nonmagical ammunition. Any pieces of ammunition created by this spell disintegrate when the spell ends. If the quiver leaves your possession, the spell ends.*
