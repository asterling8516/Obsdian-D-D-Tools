# Wrath of Nature

**Wrath of Nature**
_5th-level Evocation_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 120 ft
**Components:** V S
**Duration:** 1 minute
**Damage/Effect:** 4d6 Slashing damage, 3d8 Bludgeoning damage

*<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">You call out to the spirits of [[nature]] to rouse them against your enemies. Choose a point you can see within range. The spirits cause trees, rocks, and grasses in a 60-foot cube centered on that point to become animated until the spell ends.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">**<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">Grasses and Undergrowth.</span>** Any area of ground in the cube that is covered by grass or undergrowth is difficult terrain for your enemies.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">**<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">Trees.</span>** At the start of each of your turns, each of your enemies within 10 feet of any tree in the cube must succeed on a [[/save dex format=long]] or take 4d6 slashing damage from whipping branches.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">**<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">Roots and Vines.</span>** At the end of each of your turns, one creature of your choice that is on the ground in the cube must succeed on a [[/save str format=long]] or become restrained until the spell ends. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength ([[Athletics]]) check against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">**<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">Rocks.</span>** As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause a loose rock in the cube to launch at a creature you can see in the cube. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 nonmagical bludgeoning damage, and it must succeed on a [[/save str format=long]] or fall prone.</p>*
