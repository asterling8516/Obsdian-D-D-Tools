# Conjure Volley

**Conjure Volley**
_5th-level Conjuration_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 150 ft
**Components:** V S M (one piece of ammunition or one thrown weapon)
**Duration:** Instantaneous
**Damage/Effect:** 8d8 Additional damage

*You fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition from a ranged weapon or throw a nonmagical weapon into the air and choose a point within range. Hundreds of duplicates of the ammunition or weapon fall in a volley from above and then disappear. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius. 20-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must make a [[/save dex format=long]]. A creature takes 8d8 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the ammunition or weapon.*
