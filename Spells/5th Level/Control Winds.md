# Control Winds

**Control Winds**
_5th-level Transmutation_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 300 ft
**Components:** V S
**Duration:** 1 hour
**Damage/Effect:** Damage

*<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">You take control of the air in a 100-foot cube that you can see within range. Choose one of the following effects when you cast the spell. The effect lasts for the spell’s duration, unless you use your action on a later turn to switch to a different effect. You can also use your action to temporarily halt the effect or to restart one you’ve halted.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">**<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">Gusts.</span>** A wind picks up within the cube, continually blowing in a horizontal direction you designate. You choose the intensity of the wind: calm, moderate, or strong. If the wind is moderate or strong, ranged weapon attacks that enter or leave the cube or pass through it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. If the wind is strong, any creature moving against the wind must spend 1 extra foot of movement for each foot moved.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">**Downdraft.** </span>You cause a sustained blast of strong wind to blow downward from the top of the cube. Ranged weapon attacks that pass through the cube or that are made against targets within it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. A creature must make a [[/save str format=long]] if it flies into the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there flying. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">**<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">Updraft.</span>** You cause a sustained updraft within the cube, rising upward from the cube’s bottom side. Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from the fall. When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to 10 feet higher than normal.</p>*
