# Holy Weapon

**Holy Weapon**
_5th-level Evocation_
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V S
**Duration:** 1 hour
**Damage/Effect:** 2d8 Radiant damage, 4d8 Radiant damage

*<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">You imbue a weapon you touch with holy power. Until the spell ends, the weapon emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra 2d8 radiant damage on a hit. If the weapon isn’t already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">As a bonus action on your turn, you can dismiss this spell and cause the weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the weapon must make a [[/save con format=long]]. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 radiant damage, and it is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded. At the end of each of its turns, a blinded creature can make a [[/save con format=long]], ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>*
