*<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">The light of dawn shines down on a location you specify within range. Until the spell ends, a 30-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder of bright light glimmers there. This light is sunlight.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">When the cylinder appears, each creature in it must make a [[/save con format=long]], taking 4d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw whenever it ends its turn in the cylinder.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">If youâ€™re within 60 feet of the cylinder, you can move it up to 60 feet as a bonus action on your turn.</p>*
