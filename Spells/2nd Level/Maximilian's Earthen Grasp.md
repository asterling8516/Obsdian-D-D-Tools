# Maximilian's Earthen Grasp

**Maximilian's Earthen Grasp**
_2nd-level Transmutation_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 30 ft
**Components:** V S M (a miniature hand sculpted from clay)
**Duration:** 1 minute
**Damage/Effect:** 2d6 Bludgeoning damage, 2d6 Bludgeoning damage

*<p>You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a [[/save str format=long]]. On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained for the spellâ€™s duration.

As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, who must make a [[/save str format=long]]. It takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

To break out, the restrained target can use its action to make a [[/check str format=long]] against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.

As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.</p>*
