# Spike Growth

**Spike Growth**
_2nd-level Transmutation_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 150 ft
**Components:** V S M (seven thorns)
**Duration:** 10 minute
**Damage/Effect:** 2d4 Piercing damage

*<p>The ground in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes Difficult Terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 Piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that canâ€™t see the area when the spell is cast must take a Search action and succeed on a Wisdom ([[Perception]] or [[Survival]]) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.</p>*
