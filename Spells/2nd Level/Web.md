# Web

**Web**
_2nd-level Conjuration_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 60 ft
**Components:** V S M (a bit of spiderweb)
**Duration:** 1 hour
**Damage/Effect:** Damage

*<p>You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point within range. The webs fill a 20-foot Cube there for the duration. The webs are Difficult Terrain, and the area within them is Lightly Obscured.

If the webs arenâ€™t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

The first time a creature enters the webs on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a [[/save dex format=long]] or have the Restrained condition while in the webs or until it breaks free.

A creature Restrained by the webs can take an action to make a Strength ([[Athletics]]) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer Restrained.

The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot Cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 Fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.</p>*
