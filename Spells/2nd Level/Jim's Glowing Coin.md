*Of the many tactics employed by master magician and renowned adventurer Jim Darkmagic, the old glowing coin trick is a time-honored classic. When you cast the spell, you hurl the coin that is the spellâ€™s material component to any spot within range. The coin lights up as if under the effect of a light spell. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the coin must succeed on a [[/save wis format=long]] or be distracted for the duration. While distracted, a creature has disadvantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks and initiative rolls.*
