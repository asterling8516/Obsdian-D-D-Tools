# Moonbeam

**Moonbeam**
_2nd-level Evocation_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 120 ft
**Components:** V S M (a moonseed leaf)
**Duration:** 1 minute
**Damage/Effect:** 2d10 Radiant damage

*<p>A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, Dim Light fills the Cylinder, and you can take a Magic action on later turns to move the Cylinder up to 60 feet.

When the Cylinder appears, each creature in it makes a [[/save con format=long]]. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 Radiant damage, and if the creature is shape-shifted (as a result of the Polymorph spell, for example), it reverts to its true form and can’t shape-shift until it leaves the Cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature also makes this save when the spell’s area moves into its space and when it enters the spell’s area or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 2.</p>*
