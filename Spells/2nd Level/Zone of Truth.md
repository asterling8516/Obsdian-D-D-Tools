**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 ft
**Components:** V S
**Duration:** 10 minute
**Damage/Effect:** Effect

*<p>You create a magical zone that guards against [[deception]] in a 15-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there makes a [[/save cha format=long]]. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether a creature succeeds or fails on this save.

An affected creature is aware of the spell and can avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive yet must be truthful.</p>*
