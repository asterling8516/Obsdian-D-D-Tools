# Darkness

**Darkness**
_2nd-level Evocation_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 60 ft
**Components:** V M (bat fur and a piece of coal)
**Duration:** 10 minute
**Damage/Effect:** Effect

*<p>For the duration, magical Darkness spreads from a point within range and fills a 15-foot-radius Sphere. [[Darkvision]] can’t see through it, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn’t being worn or carried, causing the Darkness to fill a 15-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the Darkness.

If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of Bright Light or Dim Light created by a spell of level 2 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.</p>*
