*<p>You try to create illusory terrors in othersâ€™ minds. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range makes a [[/save wis format=long]]. On a failed save, a target takes 10d10 Psychic damage and has the Frightened condition for the duration. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.
