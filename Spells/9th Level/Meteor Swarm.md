# Meteor Swarm

**Meteor Swarm**
_9th-level Evocation_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 5280 ft
**Components:** V S
**Duration:** Instantaneous
**Damage/Effect:** 20d6 Fire damage, 20d6 Bludgeoning damage

*<p>Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius Sphere centered on each of those points makes a [[/save dex format=long]]. A creature takes 20d6 Fire damage and 20d6 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery Sphere is affected only once.

A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area, and the object starts burning if it’s flammable.</p>*
