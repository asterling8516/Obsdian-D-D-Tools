# Blight

**Blight**
_4th-level Necromancy_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 30 ft
**Components:** V S
**Duration:** Instantaneous
**Damage/Effect:** 8d8 Necrotic damage

*<p>A creature that you can see within range makes a [[/save con format=long]], taking 8d8 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Plant creature automatically fails the save.

Alternatively, target a nonmagical plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree or shrub. It doesn’t make a save; it simply withers and dies.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 4.</p>*
