# Black Tentacles

**Black Tentacles**
_4th-level Conjuration_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 90 ft
**Components:** V S M (a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid)
**Duration:** 1 minute
**Damage/Effect:** 3d6 Bludgeoning damage

*<p>Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a [[/save dex format=long]] or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.

A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or [[/check dex format=long]] (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.</p>*
