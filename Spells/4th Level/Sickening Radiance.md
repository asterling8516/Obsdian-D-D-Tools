*<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">Dim, greenish light spreads within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The light spreads around corners, and it lasts until the spell ends.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">When a creature moves into the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a [[/save con format=long]] or take 4d10 radiant damage, suffer one level of exhaustion, and emit a dim, greenish light in a 5-foot radius. This light makes it impossible for the creature to benefit from being invisible. The light and any levels of exhaustion caused by this spell go away when the spell ends.</p>*
