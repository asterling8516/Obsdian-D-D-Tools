# Evard's Black Tentacles

**Evard's Black Tentacles**
_4th-level Conjuration_
**Casting Time:** 1 action
**Attack/Save:** None
**Range:** 90 ft
**Components:** V S M (a tentacle)
**Duration:** 1 minute
**Damage/Effect:** 3d6 Bludgeoning damage

*<p>Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in that area into Difficult Terrain.

Each creature in that area makes a [[/save str format=long]]. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 Bludgeoning damage, and it has the Restrained condition until the spell ends. A creature also makes that save if it enters the area or ends it turn there. A creature makes that save only once per turn.

A Restrained creature can take an action to make a Strength ([[Athletics]]) check against your spell save DC, ending the condition on itself on a success.</p>*
