*Every few years, a ghost orchid colony grows a black pod as thick as a human fist that holds three soft, black seeds. A creature that consumes one of these black seeds is affected by the spell feign death. If the creature is unaware of the podâ€™s effects or does not wish to be affected, it can resist the effect by succeeding on a [[/save con 16 format=long]]. Otherwise, it is considered to be a willing recipient of the spell.*
