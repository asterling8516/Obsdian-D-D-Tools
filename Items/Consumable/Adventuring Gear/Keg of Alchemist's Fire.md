*A keg of alchemistâ€™s fire lobbed at a creature or an object deals  [[/damage 6d6 type=fire average=true]] damage on a hit. Further, the target is set ablaze and takes the damage again every round (in the case of a creature, at the start of each of its turns) until the fire is put out. A creature within reach of the blaze can take an action to smother the flames using a blanket or carpet, reducing the fire damage by 2d6. Three such actions are needed to fully put out the fire.*
