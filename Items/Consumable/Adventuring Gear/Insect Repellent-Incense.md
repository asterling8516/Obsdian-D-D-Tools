*<p>Insect repellent can be purchased in Port Nyanzaru in two forms: blocks of incense or a greasy salve. The merchant prince Kwayothé controls the sale of both. Neither kind of repellent protects against giant insects or the vile swarms of insects described in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/mm/miscellaneous-creatures">appendix A</a> of the *Monster Manual*.

A block of incense sells for 1 sp. When lit, it burns for 8 hours and repels normal insects within a 20-foot-radius centered on it.
