# Insect Repellent-Salve

**Insect Repellent-Salve**
_Trinket_
**Type:** Trinket
**Quantity:** 20
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 1 gp
**Rarity:** 
**Attunement:** None

*<p>Insect repellent can be purchased in Port Nyanzaru in two forms: blocks of incense or a greasy salve. The merchant prince Kwayothé controls the sale of both. Neither kind of repellent protects against giant insects or the vile swarms of insects described in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/mm/miscellaneous-creatures">appendix A</a> of the *Monster Manual*.

A gourd or vial of salve, which sells for 1 gp, contains 20 applications of odorless grease. One application protects its wearer against normal insects for 24 hours. The salve is waterproof so it doesn’t wash off in rain.</p>*
