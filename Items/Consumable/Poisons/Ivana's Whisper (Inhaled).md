*<p>This poison bears a distinct scent and chemical message from Ivana Boritsi. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a [[/save con 18 format=long]] or experience the effects of a dream spell created by Ivana the next time they sleep. This poison is nonmagical, and Ivana doesn’t directly communicate with those affected during the dream. Rather, she creates the [[illusion]] of speaking with her intended target by alchemically crafting her message, predicting her target’s reactions, and chemically encoding in her responses. She wears this poison as a perfume or hides it within gift bouquets, allowing it to convey her message later.

**Inhaled.** These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.</p>*
