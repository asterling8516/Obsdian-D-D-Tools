*Introduced into Sharn by Daask, dragon’s blood is a potent and highly addictive stimulant. In addition to inducing euphoria, it can enhance spellcasting ability or even temporarily imbue a user with the ability to cast sorcerer spells. The drug’s effects are potentially dangerous and always unpredictable. This isn’t something a player character should want to use; adventurers are more likely to interfere with Daask smugglers or deal with an addict who accidentally casts a fireball in a crowded street. The specific effects of dragon’s blood are up to you, but you can take inspiration from the <a title="Wild Magic Surge table" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/sorcerer#WildMagicSurgeTable">Wild Magic Surge table</a> in the *<a title="Player's Handbook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">Player’s Handbook</a>*.*
