*<p>A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a [[/save con 16 format=long]] or take  [[/damage 1d6 type=poison average=true]] damage and become poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, taking  [[/damage 1d6 type=poison average=true]] damage on a failed save. Until this poison ends, the damage the poison deals can't be healed by any means. After seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the creature can heal normally.

**Ingested.** A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.</p>*
