*A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a [[/save con 16 format=long]] or become poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature must use its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach.

The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.*
