# Burnt Othur Fumes (Inhaled)

**Burnt Othur Fumes (Inhaled)**
_Potion_
**Type:** Potion
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 500 gp
**Rarity:** 
**Attunement:** None

*<p>A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a [[/save con 13 format=long]] or take  [[/damage 3d6 type=poison average=true]] damage, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On each successive failed save, the character takes  [[/damage 1d6 type=poison average=true]] damage. After three successful saves, the poison ends.

**Inhaled.** These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.</p>*
