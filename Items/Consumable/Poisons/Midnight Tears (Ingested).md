*<p>A creature that ingests this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a [[/save con 17 format=long]], taking  [[/damage 9d6 type=poison average=true]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Ingested.** A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.</p>*
