*<p>This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a **potion of healing** or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by [[illusion]] magic. An ****[[Compendium.world.ddb-eureka-ddb-spells.Item.b8Bhrkt4rTABvCpa|identify]] spell reveals its true [[nature]].

If you drink it, you take  [[/damage 3d6 type=poison average=true]] damage, and you must succeed on a [[/save con 13 format=long]] or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.</p>*
