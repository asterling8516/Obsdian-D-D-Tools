**Potion of Longevity**
_Potion_
**Type:** Potion
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 20000 gp
**Rarity:** Veryrare
**Attunement:** None

*<p>When you drink this potion, your physical age is reduced by 1d6 + 6 years, to a minimum of 13 years. Each time you subsequently drink a *Potion of Longevity*, there is 10 percent cumulative chance that you instead age by 1d6 + 6 years.

Suspended in this amber liquid is a tiny heart that, against all reason, is still beating. These ingredients vanish when the potion is opened.</p>*
