# Potion of Diminution

**Potion of Diminution**
_Potion_
**Type:** Potion
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 2000 gp
**Rarity:** Rare
**Attunement:** None

*<p>When you drink this potion, you gain the “reduce” effect of the Enlarge/Reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no Concentration required).

The red in the potion’s liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.</p>*
