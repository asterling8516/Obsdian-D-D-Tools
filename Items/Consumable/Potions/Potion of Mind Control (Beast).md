*<p>When you drink a potion of mind control (beast), you can cast a dominate spell (save DC 15) on a specific creature if you do so before the end of your next turn. If you don’t, the potion is wasted.

A potion of mind control (beast) produces the effect of a dominate beast. If the target’s initial saving throw fails, the effect lasts for 1 hour, with no concentration required on your part. The charmed creature has disadvantage on new saving throws to break the effect during this time. (Against the Giants)</p>*
