**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 200 gp
**Rarity:** Uncommon
**Attunement:** None

*<p>After drinking this potion, you can take a Bonus Action to exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of yourself. The target makes a [[/save dex 13 format=long]], taking  [[/damage 4d6 type=fire average=true]] damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The effect ends after you exhale the fire three times or when 1 hour has passed.

This potionâ€™s orange liquid flickers, and smoke fills the top of the container and wafts out whenever it is opened.</p>*
