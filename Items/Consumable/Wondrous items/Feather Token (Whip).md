# Feather Token (Whip)

**Feather Token (Whip)**
_Trinket_
**Type:** Trinket
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 4500 gp
**Rarity:** Rare
**Attunement:** None

*<p>This tiny object looks like a feather.

You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes  [[/damage 1d6 + 5 type=force average=true]] damage.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die.</p>*
