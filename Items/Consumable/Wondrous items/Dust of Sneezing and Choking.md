# Dust of Sneezing and Choking

**Dust of Sneezing and Choking**
_Trinket_
**Type:** Trinket
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 150 gp
**Rarity:** Uncommon
**Attunement:** None

*<p>Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be **dust of disappearance**, and an [[Compendium.world.ddb-eureka-ddb-spells.Item.b8Bhrkt4rTABvCpa|identify]] spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a [[/save con 15 format=long]] or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The [[Compendium.world.ddb-eureka-ddb-spells.Item.MUbym4xcVBaGfs8t|lesser restoration]] spell can also end the effect on a creature.</p>*
