*<p>*Smokepowder* is a magical explosive chiefly used to propel a bullet out of the barrel of a firearm. It is stored in airtight wooden kegs or tiny, waterproof leather packets. A packet contains enough *smokepowder* for five shots, and a keg holds enough *smokepowder* for five hundred shots.

If *smokepowder* is set on fire, dropped, or otherwise handled roughly, it explodes and deals fire damage to each creature or object within 20 feet of it: 1d6 for a packet, 9d6 for a keg. A successful [[/save dex 12 format=long]] halves the damage.

Casting dispel magic on *smokepowder* renders it permanently inert.</p>*
