*<p>This weapon is decorated with dragon heads, claws, wings, scales, or Draconic letters. When it steeps in a dragon’s hoard, it absorbs the energy of the dragon’s breath weapon and deals damage of that type with its special properties.

***Slumbering (Uncommon).*** Whenever you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this weapon, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target takes 5 damage of the type dealt by the dragon’s breath weapon.

***Stirring (Rare).*** The Stirring weapon has the Slumbering property. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made using the weapon. On a hit, the weapon deals an extra  [[/damage 1d6 average=true]] damage of the type dealt by the dragon’s breath weapon.

***Wakened (Very Rare).*** The Wakened weapon has the Slumbering property, and it improves on the Stirring property. The bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2, and the extra damage dealt by the weapon increases to 2d6.

As an action, you can unleash a 30-foot cone of destructive energy from the weapon. Each creature in that area must make a [[/save dex 16 format=long]], taking  [[/damage 8d6 average=true]] damage of the type dealt by the dragon’s breath weapon on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this action is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn. </p>*
