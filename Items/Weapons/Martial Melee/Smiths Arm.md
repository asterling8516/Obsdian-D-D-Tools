*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a level 18 Artificer, Magic Item Master)</i><p>You replace your dominate arm with this magic item. Giving you a -1 to Charisma. There also seems to be a space in the arm for something missing?

The Arm blade gives you +5 to hit and damage rolls.Â 

As a bonus action, you can retract the armblade into your forearm or extend it from there. While it is extended, you can use the weapon as if you were holding it, and you can't use that hand for other purposes.</p>*
