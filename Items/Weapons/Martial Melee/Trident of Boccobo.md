*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a A person strong with magic must attune this item)</i><p>This magic weapon grants an additional attack (damage) die, and it returns to the wielder’s hand immediately after it is used to make a ranged attack. If a charge is used (X) golden tridents appear in spell circles floating behind the user. They each do 1.5 times of one attack die. (eg. if a 4 were to be rolled the damage of the summoned trident would be 6). The summoned tridents attack the same creature that the original hits. If the original misses, they attack randomly. The charge lasts 1d20+10 minuets. 

X is equal to your level + INT modifier (eg. A level five cleric with a +3 to Intelligence would get 8 summoned tridents)</p>*
