*<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">Seeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince came to believe that his people needed something to unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such<span class="No-Break"> a symbol.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Brutal Pick</span>**, the **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Earthheart Forge</span>**, the **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Anvil of Songs</span>**, and the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">**Shaping Hammer**.</span> With them, he forged the **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Axe of the Dwarv</span>**<span class="No-Break"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">**ish Lords**.</span></span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many ge<span class="No-Break">nerations.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults t<span class="No-Break">o find it.</span></p>

<h6 class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">Conjure Earth Elemental</span></h6>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">If you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">conjure elemental</span> spell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can’t use this property again until the <span class="No-Break">next dawn.</span></p>

<h6 class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">Curse</span></h6>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">The axe bears a curse that affects any non-dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature’s physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren’t considered magical in [[nature]] (and therefore can’t be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">greater restoration</span> or <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">remove cu</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">rse</span></span><span class="No-Break"> spell.</span></p>
<h6 class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Italic-Serif">Destroying the Axe</span></h6>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Earthheart Forge</span>**, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is<span class="No-Break"> consumed.<br /><br /></span></p>*
