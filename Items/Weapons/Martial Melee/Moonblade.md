*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a Elf or Half-Elf of Neutral Good Alignment)</i><p class="Core-Styles_Core-Metadata">Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">**moonblade**.</span> In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapo<span class="No-Break">ns remain.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">A **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">moonblade</span>** passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to <span class="No-Break">its power.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">A **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">moonblade</span>** serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the e<span class="No-Break">lven gods.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">A **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">moonblade</span>** won’t serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is <span class="No-Break">destroyed.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">A **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">moonblade</span>** has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">moonblade</span> **an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Propert<span class="No-Break">ies table.</span></p>

<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">A **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">moonblade</span>** is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and [[darkvision]] out to a range of<span class="No-Break"> 120 feet.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder’s hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance <span class="No-Break">or asleep.</span></p>

<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">Every **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">moonblade</span>** seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of thi<span class="No-Break">s purpose.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is<span class="No-Break"> absolute.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">If a **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">moonblade</span>** has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elv<span class="No-Break">en ideals.</span></p>*
