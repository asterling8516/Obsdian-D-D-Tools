*<p>A sentient (neutral evil) greatsword, *Hazirawn* is capable of speech in Common and Netherese. Even if you aren’t attuned to the sword, you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you aren’t attuned to *Hazirawn*, you deal an extra  [[/damage 1d6 type=necrotic average=true]] damage when you hit with it.

***Increased Potency.*** While you are attuned to this weapon, its bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls increases to +2, and a hit deals an extra  [[/damage 2d6 type=necrotic average=true]] damage (instead of 1d6).

***Spells.*** *Hazirawn* has 4 charges to cast spells. As long as the sword is attuned to you and you are holding it in your hand, you can use an action to expend the required number of charges to cast one of the following spells from the sword: detect magic (1 charge), detect evil and good (1 charge), or detect thoughts (2 charges). Each night at midnight, *Hazirawn* regains 1d4 expended charges.

***Wounding.*** While you are attuned to the weapon, any creature that you hit with *Hazirawn* can’t regain hit points for 1 minute. The target can make a [[/save con 15 format=long]] at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect early on itself on a success.</p>*
