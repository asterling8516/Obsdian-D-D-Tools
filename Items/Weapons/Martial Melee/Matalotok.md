*<p>*Matalotok*, the Frost Father, is an ancient hammer fashioned by Thrym, the god of frost giants. The favored weapon of the demon lord Kostchtchie, Matalotok is frigid to the touch and wreathed in mist.

You are immune to cold damage while holding *Matalotok*. Whenever it deals damage to a creature, the hammer radiates a burst of intense cold in a 30-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area takes  [[/damage 3d6 type=cold average=true]] damage.</p>*
