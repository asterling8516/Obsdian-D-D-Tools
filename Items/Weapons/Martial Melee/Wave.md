*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a Creature that Worships a God of the Sea)</i><p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">Held in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, this trident is an exquisite weapon engraved with images of waves, shells, and sea creatures. Although you must worship a god of the sea to attune to this weapon, **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Wave</span>** happily accepts new<span class="No-Break"> converts.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you score a critical hit with it, the target takes extra necrotic damage equal to half its hit poin<span class="No-Break">t maximum.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">The weapon also functions as a <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">trident of fish command</span> and a <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">weapon of warning</span>. It can confer the benefit of a <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">cap of water breathing</span> while you hold it, and you can use it as a <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">cube of force</span> by choosing the effect, instead of pressing cube sides to <span class="No-Break">select it.</span></p>
<h6 class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">Sentience</span></h6>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">**<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Wave</span>** is a sentient weapon of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and [[darkvision]] out to a range of<span class="No-Break"> 120 feet.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Aquan. It can also speak with aquatic animals as if using a <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">speak with animals</span> spell, using telepathy to involve its wielder in the con<span class="No-Break">versation.</span></p>
<h6 class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">Personality</span></h6>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">When it grows restless, **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Wave</span>** has a habit of humming tunes that vary from sea chanteys to sacred hymns of the<span class="No-Break"> sea gods.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Wave</span> zealously desires to convert mortals to the worship of one or more sea gods, or else to consign the faithless to death. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to further the weapon’s objectives in <span class="No-Break">the world.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">The trident has a nostalgic attachment to the place where it was forged, a desolate island called Thunderforge. A sea god imprisoned a family of storm giants there, and the giants forged **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Wave</span>** in an act of devotion to—or rebellion against<span class="No-Break">—that god.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Wave</span> harbors a secret doubt about its own [[nature]] and purpose. For all its devotion to the sea gods, **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Wave</span>** fears that it was intended to bring about a particular sea god’s demise. This destiny is something **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Wave</span>** might not be able<span class="No-Break"> to avert.</span></p>*
