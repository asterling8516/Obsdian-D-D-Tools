*<p>This magic flail is made in the image of Tiamat, with five jagged heads shaped like the heads of five different chromatic dragons. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this flail. When you hit with an attack roll using it, the target takes an extra  [[/damage 5d4 average=true]] damage of your choice of one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.

While holding the flail, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause the heads to breathe multicolored flames in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a [[/save dex 18 format=long]].
