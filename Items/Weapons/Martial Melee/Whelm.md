*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a dwarf)</i><p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Whelm</span> is a powerful warhammer forged by dwarves and lost in the dungeon of White Plume<span class="No-Break"> Mountain.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. At dawn the day after you first make an attack roll with **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Whelm</span>**, you develop a fear of being outdoors that persists as long as you remain attuned to the weapon. This causes you to have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks while you can see the da<span class="No-Break">ytime sky.</span></p>
<h6 class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">Thrown Weapon</span></h6>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">**<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Whelm</span>** has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using it, the target takes an extra  [[/damage 1d8 type=bludgeoning average=true]] damage, or an extra  [[/damage 2d8 type=bludgeoning average=true]] damage if the target is a giant. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack. If you don’t have a hand free, the weapon lands at <span class="No-Break">your feet.</span></p>
<h6 class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">Shock Wave</span></h6>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">You can use an action to strike the ground with **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Whelm</span>** and send a shock wave out from the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a [[/save con 15 format=long]] or become stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the <span class="No-Break">next dawn.</span></p>
<h6 class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">Supernatural Awareness</span></h6>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">While you are holding the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or concealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you can use an action to cast <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">detect evil and good </span>or<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif"> locate object</span> from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you can’t cast it from the weapon again until the <span class="No-Break">next dawn.</span></p>
<h6 class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">Sentience</span></h6>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">**<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Whelm</span>** is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and [[darkvision]] out to a range of<span class="No-Break"> 120 feet.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Dwarvish, Giant, and Goblin. It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish when used <span class="No-Break">in combat.</span></p>
<h6 class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">Personality</span></h6>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Whelm</span>’s purpose is to slaughter giants and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy goblins and giants or to protec<span class="No-Break">t dwarves.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">**<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Whelm</span>** has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything to protect those dwarves <span class="No-Break">from harm.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire. His will was strong enough that he bent **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Whelm</span>** to his evil purposes, even killing members of his<span class="No-Break"> own clan.</span></p>*
