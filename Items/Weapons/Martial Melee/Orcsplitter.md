*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a Good-Aligned Dwarf, Fighter, or Paladin)</i><p>A mighty axe wielded long ago by the dwarf king Torhild Flametongue, Orcsplitter is a battered weapon that appears unremarkable at first glance. Its head is graven with the Dwarvish runes for “orc,” but the runes are depicted with a gap or slash through the markings; the word “orc” is literally split in two.

You gain the following benefits while holding this magic weapon:</p>
* You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
* When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon against an orc, that orc must succeed on a [[/save con 17 format=long]] or drop to 0 hit points.
* You can’t be surprised by orc<span style="color:#bc0f0f">**s**</span> while you’re not incapacitated. You are also aware when orc**<span style="color:#bc0f0f">s</span>** are within 120 feet of you and aren’t behind total cover, although you don’t know their location.
* You and any of your friends within 30 feet of you can’t be frightened while you’re not incapacitated.

<p>**Sentience.** Orcsplitter is a sentient, lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 6, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 10. It can see and hear out to 120 feet and has [[darkvision]]. It communicates by transmitting emotions to its wielder, although on rare occasions it uses a limited form of telepathy to bring to the wielder’s mind a couplet or stanza of ancient Dwarvish verse.

**Personality.** Orcsplitter is grim, taciturn, and inflexible. It knows little more than the desire to face orcs in battle and serve a courageous, just wielder. It disdains cowards and any form of duplicity, [[deception]], or disloyalty. The weapon’s purpose is to defend dwarves and to serve as a symbol of dwarven resolve. It hates the traditional foes of dwarves — giants, goblin**<span style="color:#bc0f0f">s</span>**, and, most of all, orc<span style="color:#bc0f0f">**s**</span> — and silently urges its possessor to meet such creatures in battle.</p>*
