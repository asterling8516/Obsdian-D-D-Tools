# Yester Hill Axe

**Yester Hill Axe**
_Martialm_
**Type:** Martialm
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** 2 lb
**Price:** N/A
**Rarity:** 
**Attunement:** None

*Its handle is carved with leaves and vines, and the weapon weighs half as much as a normal battleaxe. When the axe hits a plant, whether an ordinary plant or a plant creature, the target takes an extra  [[/damage 1d8 type=slashing average=true]] damage. When a creature of non-good alignment wields the axe, it sprouts thorns whenever its wielder makes an attack with it. These thorns prick the wielder for 1 piercing damage after the attack is made, and this damage is considered magical.*
