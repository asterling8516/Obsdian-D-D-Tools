*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a Creature of Non-Lawful Alignment)</i><p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">Hidden in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Blackrazor</span>** shines like a piece of night sky filled with stars. Its black scabbard is decorated with pieces of cut<span class="No-Break"> obsidian.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional p<span class="No-Break">roperties.</span></p>
<h6 class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">Devour Soul</span></h6>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">Whenever you use it to reduce a creature to 0 hit points, the sword slays the creature and devours its soul, unless it is a construct or an undead. A creature whose soul has been devoured by **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Blackrazor </span>**can be restored to life only by a <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">w</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">ish</span></span><span class="No-Break"> spell.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">When it devours a soul, **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Blackrazor</span>** grants you temporary hit points equal to the slain creature’s hit point maximum. These hit points fade after 24 hours. As long as these temporary hit points last and you keep**<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif"> Blackrazor</span>** in hand, you have advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and abili<span class="No-Break">ty checks.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">If you hit an undead with this weapon, you take  [[/damage 1d10 type=necrotic average=true]] damage and the target regains [[/damage 1d10 type=heal average=false]] hit points. If this necrotic damage reduces you to 0 hit points, **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Blackrazor</span>** devours <span class="No-Break">your soul.</span></p>
<h6 class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">Soul Hunter</span></h6>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">While you hold the weapon, you are aware of the presence of Tiny or larger creatures within 60 feet of you that aren’t constructs or undead. You also can’t be charmed or f<span class="No-Break">rightened.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">**<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Blackrazor</span> **can cast the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">haste</span> spell on you once per day. It decides when to cast the spell and maintains concentration on it so that you don’<span class="No-Break">t have to.</span></p>
<h6 class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">Sentience</span></h6>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">**<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Blackrazor</span>** is a sentient chaotic neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and [[darkvision]] out to a range of<span class="No-Break"> 120 feet.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you are attuned to it, <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Blackrazor</span> also understands every language<span class="No-Break"> you know.</span></p>
<h6 class="Core-Styles_Core-Body"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif">Personality</span></h6>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">**<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Blackrazor</span>** speaks with an imperious tone, as though accustomed to bei<span class="No-Break">ng obeyed.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">The sword’s purpose is to consume souls. It doesn’t care whose souls it eats, including the wielder’s. The sword believes that all matter and energy sprang from a void of negative energy and will one day return to it.**<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif"> Blackrazor</span> **is meant to hurry that proc<span class="No-Break">ess along.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">Despite its nihilism, **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Blackrazor</span> **feels a strange kinship to **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Wave</span>** and **<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Whelm</span>**, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three weapons to be united again and wielded together in combat, even though it violently disagrees with <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Whelm</span> and finds <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Wav</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">e</span></span><span class="No-Break"> tedious.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">**<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">Blackrazor</span>’s** hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If the sword goes three days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the ne<span class="No-Break">xt sunset.</span></p>*
