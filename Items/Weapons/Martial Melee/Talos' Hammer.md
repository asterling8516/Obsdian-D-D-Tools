**Talos' Hammer**
_Martialm_
**Type:** Martialm
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** 5 lb
**Price:** 125000 gp
**Rarity:** Legendary
**Attunement:** Requires Attunement

*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a You must hold the hammer for the duration of a thunderstorm)</i><p>You gain +1 to hit. When attacking you do  [[/damage 1d10 type=bludgeoning average=true]] damage.  

The hammer also has 5 charges.

<b>Expend 1 Charge.</b>

Make a ranged weapon attack with the hammer, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the hammer unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on a [[/save con 17 format=long]] or be stunned until the end of your next turn. The hammer regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. 

**Epend 2 Charges.**

You now add  [[/damage 1d8 type=lightning average=true]] damage on a successful attack. This effect lasts one hour. 

**Expend 4 Charges.**

You point the hammer in a single direction casting lightning bolt from the hammer. A stroke of lightning cast from the hammer forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out. Each creature in the line must make a [[/save dex format=long]]. A creature takes  [[/damage 8d6 type=lightning average=true]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br />The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. DEX save is (Your level + CON + 3)

**Expending 5 Charges and During a Crit. **

Your hammer grants you the power to control the very storms that wreak havoc on the world. The hammer grants you all of the abilities 1-4 and a large storm appears above you as storm of vengeance. The spell's duration is until the end of the encounter or the user of the hammer hits 0 hp whichever comes first. The following occurs. 

A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and spreading to a radius of 360 feet. Lightning flashes in the area, thunder booms, and strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a [[/save con format=long]]. On a failed save, a creature takes  [[/damage 2d6 type=thunder average=true]] damage and becomes defend for 5 minutes. 

Each round you maintain concentration on this spell, the storm produces different effects on your turn.

**Round 2.** Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and object under the cloud takes  [[/damage 1d6 type=acid average=true]] damage.

**Round 3.** You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six creatures or objects of your choice beneath the cloud. A given creature or object can't be struck by more than one bolt. A struck creature must make a [[/save dex format=long]]. The creature takes  [[/damage 10d6 type=lightning average=true]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Round 4.** Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under the cloud takes  [[/damage 2d6 type=bludgeoning average=true]] damage.

**Round 5–10.** Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature there takes  [[/damage 1d6 type=cold average=true]] damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane or magical.</p>*
