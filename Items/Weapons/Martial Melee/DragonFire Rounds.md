*<p>Fire Damage: Dragonfire Rounds are specially crafted with alchemical components that burst into flames upon impact. In addition to the regular piercing damage, they deal an additional  [[/damage 4d6 type=fire average=true]] damage to the target on a successful hit.

Explosive Ignition: Upon striking a target or surface, Dragonfire Rounds have a chance to ignite flammable materials or create a small area of fire. When using Dragonfire Rounds, the DM can choose to set objects or creatures hit by the rounds on fire, causing them to take additional fire damage at the start of their turn unless they or someone else takes an action to extinguish the flames.

Crafting: Crafting Dragonfire Rounds requires proficiency with Tinker's Tools and the Gunsmithing feat. The materials cost for a box of 12 Dragonfire Rounds is 50 gold pieces.</p>*
