# Staff of Swarming Insects

**Staff of Swarming Insects**
_Simplem_
**Type:** Simplem
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 6000 gp
**Rarity:** Rare
**Attunement:** Requires Attunement

*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)</i><p>This staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, a swarm of insects consumes and destroys the staff, then disperses.

**Spells.** While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: ****[[Compendium.world.ddb-eureka-ddb-spells.Item.aTXoeLWjgnY3YPf7|giant insect]] (4 charges) or ****[[Compendium.world.ddb-eureka-ddb-spells.Item.fcGm2gTIv8NqYIRI|insect plague]] (5 charges).

**Insect Cloud.** While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause a swarm of harmless flying insects to spread out in a 30-foot radius from you. The insects remain for 10 minutes, making the area heavily obscured for creatures other than you. The swarm moves with you, remaining centered on you. A wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses the swarm and ends the effect.</p>*
