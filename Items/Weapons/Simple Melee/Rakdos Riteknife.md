*<p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Its blade is cruelly serrated, and its hilt resembles a demonic head and wings. Whenever you slay a creature with an attack using the dagger, the creature’s soul is imprisoned inside the dagger, and that creature can be restored to life only by a wish spell. The dagger can hold a maximum of five souls.

For each soul imprisoned in the dagger, your attacks with it deal an extra  [[/damage 1d4 type=necrotic average=true]] damage on a hit. While the dagger is within 5 feet of you, your dreams are haunted by whispers from the trapped souls.

The dagger has the following additional properties.

***Siphon Vitality.*** As a bonus action, you can release any number of stored souls from the dagger to regain [[/damage 1d10 type=heal average=false]] hit points per soul released.

***Annihilation.*** If the dagger holds five souls, you can use this property: As a reaction immediately after you hit a creature with the dagger and deal damage to that target, you can release all five souls. If the target now has fewer than 75 hit points, it must succeed on a [[/save con 15 format=long]] or die. If the target dies, you can’t use this property again until you finish a long rest.</p>*
