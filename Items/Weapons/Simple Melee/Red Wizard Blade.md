*<p>Forged by Red Wizards using a secret process known only to them, this grim steel dagger draws its power from the Negative Plane. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using this magic dagger, the target takes an extra  [[/damage 3d12 type=necrotic average=true]] damage.

A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this weapon dies and canâ€™t be raised from the dead except by a deity or by a creature using a tablet of reawakening to cast the true resurrection spell.</p>*
