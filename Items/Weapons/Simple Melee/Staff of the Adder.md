*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or warlock)</i><p>You can use a bonus action to speak the staff's command word and make the head of the staff become that of an animate poisonous snake for 1 minute. By using another bonus action to speak the command word again, you return the staff to its normal inanimate form.

You can make a melee attack using the snake head, which has a reach of 5 feet. Your proficiency bonus applies to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes  [[/damage 1d6 type=piercing average=true]] damage and must succeed on a [[/save con 15 format=long]] or take  [[/damage 3d6 type=poison average=true]] damage.

The snake head can be attacked while it is animate. It has an Armor Class of 15 and 20 hit points. If the head drops to 0 hit points, the staff is destroyed. As long as it's not destroyed, the staff regains all lost hit points when it reverts to its animate form.</p>*
