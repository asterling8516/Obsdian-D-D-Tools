# Gulthias Staff

**Gulthias Staff**
_Simplem_
**Type:** Simplem
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 8000 gp
**Rarity:** Rare
**Attunement:** Requires Attunement

*<p>Made from the branch of a Gulthias tree (see the <a title="Monster Manual - Blights" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm/monsters-b#Blights">blights entry</a> in the *<a title="Monster Manual" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm">Monster Manual</a>*), a *Gulthias staff* is a spongy, black length of wood. Its evil makes beasts visibly uncomfortable while within 30 feet of it. The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 of its expended charges daily at dusk.

If the staff is broken or burned to ashes, its wood releases a terrible, inhuman scream that can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. All blights that can hear the scream immediately wither and die.

***Vampiric Strike.*** The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge to regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt by the weapon. Each time a charge is spent, red blood oozes from the staff’s pores, and you must succeed on a [[/save wis 12 format=long]] or be afflicted with short-term madness (see “<a title="Dungeon Master's Guide - Madness" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#Madness">Madness</a>” in chapter 8 of the *<a title="Dungeon Master’s Guide" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>*).

***Blight Bane.*** While you are attuned to the staff, blights and other evil plant creatures don’t regard you as hostile unless you harm them.</p>*
