*<p>The creations of the immortal hag Baba Yaga defy the laws of mortal magic. Among the notorious implements that cement her legend on countless worlds are the artifacts that propel her through the planes: Baba Yaga’s Mortar and Pestle. These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn.

***Random Properties.** *This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the “<a title="Artifacts" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/sentient-magic-items-artifacts#Artifacts">Artifacts</a>” section of the *<a title="Dungeon Master’s Guide" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>*:</p>

* 1 minor detrimental property

<p>***Properties of the Pestle.*** The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra  [[/damage 1d8 type=force average=true]] damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

***Destroying the Mortar and Pestle.*** The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the *Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga* or by Baba Yaga herself.</p>*
