*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a Druid)</i><p>This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.

The staff has 15 charges for the following properties. It regains 4d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the staff regains 1d12 + 1 charges.

**Tree Form.** You can use an action to plant one end of the staff in fertile earth and expend 1 charge to transform the staff into a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of [[transmutation]] magic if targeted by ******detect magic**. While touching the tree and using another action to speak its command word, you return the staff to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a staff.

**Spells.** While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: ****[[Compendium.world.ddb-eureka-ddb-spells.Item.5wEv29iXrrkhDpXj|conjure elemental]] (7 charges), ****[[Compendium.world.ddb-eureka-ddb-spells.Item.qhQgByUdpRV7dFzb|dispel magic]] (3 charges), ****[[Compendium.world.ddb-eureka-ddb-spells.Item.GRkAoLZZniDwCj9a|knock]] (2 charges), ******awaken** (5 charges), ******barkskin** (2 charges), ******locate animals or plants** (2 charges), ******speak with plants** (3 charges), or ******wall of thorns** (6 charges), **thorn whip****** (2 charges), **tree stride****** (5 charges), **transport via plants****** (10 charges).

You can also use an action to cast the ******pass without trace** spell from the staff without using any charges.

You gain an advantage when you're facing a plant or a [[nature]] spell is used against you. </p>*
