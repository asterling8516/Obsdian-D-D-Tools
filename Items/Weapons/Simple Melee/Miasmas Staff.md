*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a being held for hour by someone who knows magic )</i><p>The staff is made from a single twisted tree branch that has hanging lanterns on the tips of its branches. It uses the transfer of mana from the user to turn "on" and "off" the lanterns who act as a torch casting bright light in a 20ft radius and dim light in an additional 20ft radius. 

This staff functions as a spell focus giving the caster a +2 to spells.
