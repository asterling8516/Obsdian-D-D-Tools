*It’s up to you to decide whether a character has proficiency with a firearm. Characters in most D&D worlds wouldn’t have such proficiency. During their downtime, characters can use the training rules in the *Player’s Handbook* to acquire proficiency, assuming that they have enough ammunition to keep the weapons working while mastering their use.
