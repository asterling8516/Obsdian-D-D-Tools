*<p>This boomerang is a ranged weapon carved from griffon bone and etched with the symbol of elemental air. When thrown, it has a range of 60/120 feet, and any creature that is proficient with the javelin is also proficient with this weapon. On a hit, the boomerang deals  [[/damage 1d4 type=bludgeoning average=true]] damage and  [[/damage 3d4 type=thunder average=true]] damage, and the target must succeed on a [[/save con 10 format=long]] or be stunned until the end of its next turn. On a miss, the boomerang returns to the throwerâ€™s hand.

Once the boomerang deals thunder damage to a target, the weapon loses its ability to deal thunder damage and its ability to stun a target. These properties return after the boomerang spends at least 1 hour inside an elemental air node.</p>*
