# Axe Beak

**Axe Beak**
_Unknown_
**Type:** Unknown
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 50 gp
**Rarity:** 
**Attunement:** None

*<p>An axe beakâ€™s splayed toes allow it to run across snow, and it can carry as much weight as a mule. A domesticated axe beak can be purchased in Ten-Towns for 50 gp.

An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.</p>*
