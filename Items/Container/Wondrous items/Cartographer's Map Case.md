*<h5>Map of Shortcuts</h5>
At rank 3, your map case becomes a common magic item. In addition to storing normal maps, your *cartographer’s map case* can be used to generate a special map identifying a shortcut. You can use your action to make a DC 15 Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check, with a success revealing a map buried in your *cartographer’s map case* noting a relevant shortcut . Your travel time is reduced by half while you follow that route. If you succeed at the check by 5 or more, the map includes notes on the terrain, granting you advantage on the next ability check you make to travel through the mapped area in the next hour. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.
<h5>Map of the Moment</h5>
Starting at rank 3, you can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check and search your *cartographer’s map case* to find a map either related to your current mission or inspiring a new one. On a success, you find a map with a prominent landmark. The map has information on the natural terrain within one mile of the landmark. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until dawn seven days later.
