<p>**CHARIOTS**

Chariots and the creatures pulling them work like controlled mounts, as described in the mounted combat rules in the *<a title="Player’s Handbook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/combat#MountedCombat">Player’s Handbook</a>*, but with the following differences:</p>
* Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs you 5 feet of movement, rather than a number of feet equal to half your speed.
* Being mounted on a chariot grants you half cover.
* A chariot’s speed is equal to the speed of the slowest creature pulling it.
* If multiple creatures are pulling the chariot, they all act on the same initiative, and they must take the same action on their turn.
