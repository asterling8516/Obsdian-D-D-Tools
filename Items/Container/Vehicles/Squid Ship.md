*<p>Among the oldest types of spelljamming vessels, squid ship;squid ships are popular with privateers and are often used as patrol ships. Standard weapons on a squid ship include a forward-mounted mangonel, two aft-mounted ballistae, and a reinforced bow for ramming. The tentacles that extend from the bow account for nearly half the shipâ€™s keel length.

Squid ships can float and sail on water, and they can land on the ground.</p>*
