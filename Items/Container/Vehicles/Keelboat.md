One of the smallest sailing vessels, keelboat;keelboats can be sailed or rowed by a single person. These ships often transport small amounts of cargo or passengers. They're perfect for pleasure cruises, as they're easier and less expensive to operate than larger vessels.

Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles canâ€™t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores.</p>*
