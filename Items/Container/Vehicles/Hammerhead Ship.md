*Hammerhead ship;Hammerhead ships are popular craft, especially among pirates and merchants carrying heavy cargo. They can float on water and sail across it, but they arenâ€™t built to land on the ground (their keels would cause them to tip to one side). Standard weapons on a hammerhead ship include fore and aft mangonels, a ballista, and a reinforced bow for ramming.*
