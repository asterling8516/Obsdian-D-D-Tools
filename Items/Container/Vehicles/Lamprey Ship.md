*<p>Lamprey Ship;Lamprey ships are antiquated, being among the oldest spelljamming ships still in use. Psurlons (see *<a title="Psurlons" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sais/bam/bestiary#Psurlons">Boo’s Astral Menagerie</a>*) are particularly fond of them.

Using the metal grappling jaws built into its bow, a lamprey ship can attach itself to another ship, which is a critical feature during boarding actions. Other standard weapons include four ballistae on the main deck.

A lamprey can float on water, though it can’t land safely on the ground. Lamprey ships that land on the ground have the distressing habit of rolling over, as more than a few crews have discovered to their dismay.</p>*
