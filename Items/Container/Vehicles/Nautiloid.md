*<p>Built and used by mind flayers, nautiloid;nautiloids are designed exclusively for space travel. They can’t float on water, nor can they land safely on the ground.

As an action, a creature attuned to a nautiloid’s spelljamming helm and in physical contact with the ship can transport the nautiloid and all creatures and objects aboard it to a different plane of existence, at or near a destination envisioned by the spelljammer (or to a random location on the plane if no destination is envisioned). This property is a feature of the ship, not the *spelljamming helm*. Each time this property is used, roll a d6. On a 5–6, the property recharges after 1 minute; otherwise, it can’t be used again for 24 hours.</p>*
