*A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus, as described in the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting#MaterialM">Spellcasting</a> section. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.*
