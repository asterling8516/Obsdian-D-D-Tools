*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a bard)</i><p>An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a [[/save wis 15 format=long]] or take  [[/damage 2d4 type=psychic average=true]] damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells: Fly, Invisibility, Levitate, Protection from Evil and Good, Control Weather, Cure Wounds (5th level), Wall of Thorns. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can’t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.</p>*
