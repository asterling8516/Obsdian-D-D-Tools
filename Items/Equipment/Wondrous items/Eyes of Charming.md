*These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the [[Compendium.world.ddb-eureka-ddb-spells.Item.baEYSlbaeP1hHEOp|charm person]] spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.*
