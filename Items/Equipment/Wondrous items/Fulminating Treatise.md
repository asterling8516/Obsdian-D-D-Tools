*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a wizard)</i><p>This thick, scorched spellbook reeks of smoke and ozone, and sparks of energy crackles along the edges of its pages. When found, the book contains the following spells: contingency, fireball, gust of wind, Leomundâ€™s tiny hut, magic missile, thunderwave, and wall of force. It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:</p>
* If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the [[evocation]] school.
* When one creature you can see takes damage from an [[evocation]] spell you cast, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to deal an extra  [[/damage 2d6 type=force average=true]] damage to the creature and knock the creature prone if it is Large or smaller.*
