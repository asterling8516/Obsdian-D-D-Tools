*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a artificer)</i><p>This simple screwdriver can transform into a variety of tools; as an action, you can touch the item and transform it into any type of artisan's tool of your choice (see the "<a title="Equipment" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment#Tools">Equipment</a>" chapter in the <a class="sourcebook" title="Player’s Handbook" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb">*Player’s Handbook*</a> for a list of artisan's tools). Whatever form the tool takes, you are proficient with it.

While holding this tool, you gain a +2 bonus to the spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your artificer spells.

As an action, you can focus on the tool to channel your creative forces. Choose a cantrip that you don't know from any class list. For 8 hours, you can cast that cantrip, and it counts as an artificer cantrip for you. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>*
