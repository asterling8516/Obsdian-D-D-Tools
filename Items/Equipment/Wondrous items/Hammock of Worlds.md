*<p>The *Hammock of Worlds* is a colorful hammock woven with traditional Ataguan designs. It can be used only by a member of the order known as the Green Doctors.

You can use an action to unfold and place the *Hammock of Worlds* on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to the Ghost Orchid Tepui in the Feywild or to the Drought Elder in the Far Realm (the user’s choice). You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once *Hammock of Worlds* has opened a portal, it can’t do so again for 1d8 hours.</p>*
