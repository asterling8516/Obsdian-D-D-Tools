*<p>This dragon’s claw has been covered with a coat of molten silver, upon which has been inscribed the wyrm (dragon) rune. The claw has the following properties.

***Wyrmslayer.*** As an action, you can point the claw at a Dragon within 30 feet of you. The target must then succeed on a [[/save con 15 format=long]] or gain vulnerability to all damage types until the end of your next turn. This property can be used three times. The claw regains all expended uses at the next dawn.

***Wyrm Shield.*** While the claw is displayed on your person, you have resistance to the damage caused by the breath weapon of any Dragon.

***Wyrm Ward.*** You can transfer the claw’s magic to a place by tracing the wyrm rune on the ground with your finger. The point where you trace it becomes the center of a spherical area of magic that has a 100-foot radius and that is fixed to the place. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the claw to be within 5 feet of you. At the end, the claw is destroyed, and the area gains the following property:

While in the 100-foot-radius sphere, any Dragon has disadvantage on saving throws and can have a flying speed no higher than 10 feet.</p>*
