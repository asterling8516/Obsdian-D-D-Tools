*Head office grants you the use of a unique item known as an *occultant abacus* (sometimes just referred to as an occultant), whose beads resemble tiny skulls.
<h5>Read the Kill</h5>
Also at rank 1, your *occultant abacus* not only tracks your franchise’s kills, it helps you determine the impact of those kills on the franchise’s fate. Over a period of 1 minute, you can study a creature killed by someone in your franchise within the last 24 hours, then grant the character who slew it a d10. Once within the next hour, that character can add the d10 to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. If it’s not clear who administered the killing blow, you grant this benefit to a random creature involved in the fight. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

<h5>Eldritch Occultant</h5>
Starting at rank 2, your *occultant abacus* becomes an uncommon magic item that can track lives both eliminated and saved. While holding your *occultant abacus* within 5 feet of a creature killed within the past 24 hours, you can cast the augury spell. The course of action you inquire about with the spell does not need to have any connection to the dead creature. This property of the *occultant abacus* can’t be used again until the next dawn.
<h5>Bring Out Your Dead</h5>
Also at rank 2, you regain the use of your Read the Kill feature after you finish a short or long rest.
<h5>Bead of Instant Karma</h5>
At rank 3, one of the beads on your *occultant abacus* channels the power of instant karma, turning the *occultant abacus* into a rare magic item. As a reaction, you can target one creature you can see that is about to attempt an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, either granting advantage or imposing disadvantage on the roll. The bead crumbles to dust when used, reappearing on your *occultant abacus* at the next dawn.
<h5>Bead of Diverted Karma</h5>
At rank 4, one of the beads on your *occultant abacus* allows you to divert karma to where it’s needed, turning the *occultant abacus* into a very rare magic item. While the bead is unused, you know automatically when any creature you can see is about to make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw with disadvantage. When such a roll is made, you can use a reaction to grant a d10 to a different creature you can see. That creature can add the d10 to any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes within the next minute. The bead crumbles to dust when used, reappearing on your *occultant abacus* at the next dawn.
<h5>Correct the Balance</h5>
<p>As a rank 4 occultant, you learn that sometimes the death of a creature has unintended consequences. Within seven days of a creature’s death, you can use your *occultant abacus* to divine ways to reverse or mitigate events resulting from that death. As an action, make a DC 15 Intelligence ([[Religion]]) check. On a success, you learn the relevant information based on the [[nature]] of the creature and its place in the world.

If you fail the check, this property of the *occultant abacus* can’t be used again until the next dawn. If you succeed on the check, this property can’t be used again until dawn seven days later.</p>*
