# Gruul Keyrune

**Gruul Keyrune**
_Trinket_
**Type:** Trinket
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A

**Rarity:** Rare
**Attunement:** Requires Attunement

*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a member of the relevant guild)</i><p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">Associated with a particular guild, a <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">guild keyrune</span> is a ceremonial, stylized key, about 1 foot long, made from carved stone. Not a literal key, the item is a badge of authority that gives its bearer access to privileged places in its guild’s headquarters and outposts. At the DM’s discretion, a character might be given a keyrune upon attaining a renown score of 25 in their guild.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">When you use an action to speak the item’s command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a creature. If there isn’t enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn’t transform. See the <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif"><i><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/mm">Monster Manual</a></i></span> for the creature’s stat block — the name of which is given in bold in the keyrune’s description — unless you’re directed to chapter 6 of this source instead.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the disable-webm=1">Dodge action and moves to avoid danger.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">The creature exists for a duration specific to each keyrune. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can’t transform again until 36 hours have passed.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">**Gruul Keyrune (Rare).** This crude keyrune is cobbled together from bits of rubble, broken glass, bone, and animal hair. One end resembles a horned beast. On command, the keyrune transforms into a ceratok, a horned creature much like a rhinoceros (and with the same statistics). It remains in its ceratok form for 1 hour.</p>*
