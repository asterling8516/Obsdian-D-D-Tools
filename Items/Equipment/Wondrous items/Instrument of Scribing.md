*<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">This musical instrument has 3 charges. While you are playing it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the instrument and write a magical message on a nonmagical object or surface that you can see within 30 feet of you. The message can be up to six words long and is written in a language you know. If you are a bard, you can scribe an additional seven words and choose to make the message glow faintly, allowing it to be seen in nonmagical darkness. Casting <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">dispel magic</span> on the message erases it. Otherwise, the message fades away after<span class="No-Break"> 24 hours.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">The instrument regains all expended charges dail<span class="No-Break">y at dawn.</span></p>*
