***Slumbering (Uncommon).*** As a bonus action, if the vessel is empty, you can speak the command word to fill the vessel with one of the following (your choice): ale, olive oil, a potion of healing, or a potion of climbing. Once this property is used, it can’t be used until the next dawn. A potion you create in this way loses its magical properties if it isn’t imbibed within 24 hours.

***Stirring (Rare).*** In addition to the options for a Slumbering vessel, you can fill a Stirring vessel with mead, a potion of fire breath, or a potion of healing (greater).

***Wakened (Very Rare).*** In addition to the options for a Slumbering or Stirring vessel, you can fill a Wakened vessel with wine, a potion of flying, or a potion of healing (superior).</p>*
