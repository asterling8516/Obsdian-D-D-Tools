# Talarith

**Talarith**
_Trinket_
**Type:** Trinket
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 75000 gp
**Rarity:** Legendary
**Attunement:** Requires Attunement

*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a Reigar Who Created It)</i><p>The reigar who creates this piece of jewelry chooses its form: bracelet, brooch, diadem, or necklace. While the reigar wears the *talarith*, any weapon wielded by the reigar deals an extra  [[/damage 1d6 type=force average=true]] damage when it hits.

As an action, a reigar can use its *talarith* to summon a duplicate that looks just like the reigar. The duplicate obeys the reigar’s commands and uses the reigar’s statistics, except it is a Construct that doesn’t have a *talarith* of its own. The duplicate vanishes after 1 hour, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. After summoning a duplicate, the reigar must finish a short or long rest before this property can be used again.</p>*
