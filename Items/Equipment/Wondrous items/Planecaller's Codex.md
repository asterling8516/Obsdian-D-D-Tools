*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a wizard)</i><p>The pages of this book are bound in fiend hide, and its cover is embossed with a diagram of the Great Wheel of the multiverse. When found, the book contains the following spells: banishment, find familiar, gate, magic circle, planar binding, and summon elementalÂ (appears in this book). It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:</p>
* If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the [[conjuration]] school.
* When you cast a [[conjuration]] spell that summons or creates one creature, you can expend 1 charge to grant that creature advantage on attack rolls for 1 minute.*
