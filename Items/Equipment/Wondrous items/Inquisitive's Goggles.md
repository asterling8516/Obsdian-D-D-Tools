**Type:** Trinket
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A

**Attunement:** Requires Attunement

*<p>The lenses of these goggles are carved from Siberys dragonshards. While garish in appearance, these goggles are a boon to any Tharashk inquisitive. To attune to the goggles, you must possess the Mark of Finding. As long as this condition is met, you gain the following benefits.

You can add your Intuition die from the Hunterâ€™s Intuition trait of the mark when you make Wisdom ([[Insight]]) checks.

When you examine an object, you can make a Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check to identify the aura of the last living creature to touch the object. The DC is 13 + the number of days since the last contact occurred. If the check is successful, you learn the species of the creature and you can immediately use your Imprint Prey ability to target this creature.</p>*
