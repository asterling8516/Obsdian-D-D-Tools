# Green Chromatic Rose

**Type:** Trinket
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 11000 gp
**Rarity:** Rare
**Attunement:** None

*<p>While a green rose is held, it issues green gas as a harmless visual effect.

While holding the rose by its stem, you gain resistance to poison damage. If you would take more than 10 poison damage from a single source (after applying the resistance), the rose disintegrates, and you take no damage instead.

As an action, you can blow the petals from the rose to produce a 20-foot cone of poisonous gas. Each creature in the cone must make a [[/save con 15 format=long]], taking  [[/damage 3d10 type=poison average=true]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Using this property destroys the rose.</p>*
