# Black Chromatic Rose

**Black Chromatic Rose**
_Trinket_
**Type:** Trinket
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 5000 gp
**Rarity:** Rare
**Attunement:** None

*<p>While a black rose is held, it drips acid as a harmless visual effect.

While holding the rose by its stem, you gain resistance to acid damage. If you would take more than 10 acid damage from a single source (after applying the resistance), the rose disintegrates, and you take no damage instead.

As an action, you can blow the petals from the rose to produce a 20-foot cone of acid. Each creature in the cone must make a [[/save con 15 format=long]], taking  [[/damage 3d10 type=acid average=true]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Using this property destroys the rose.</p>*
