# Baba Yaga's Mortar

_Trinket_
**Type:** Trinket
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 900000 gp
**Rarity:** Artifact

*<p>The creations of the immortal hag Baba Yaga defy the laws of mortal magic. Among the notorious implements that cement her legend on countless worlds are the artifacts that propel her through the planes: Baba Yaga’s Mortar and Pestle. These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn.

***Random Properties.*** This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "<a title="Artifacts" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/sentient-magic-items-artifacts#Artifacts">Artifacts</a>" section of the *<a class="sourcebook" title="Dungeon Master's Guide" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>*:</p>

<p>***Properties of the Mortar.*** The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding—if there's enough space—up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature.

***Traverse the Night.*** If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature. You don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.

***Bones Know Their Home.*** When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute.

***Destroying the Mortar and Pestle.*** The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the *Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga* or by Baba Yaga herself.</p>*
