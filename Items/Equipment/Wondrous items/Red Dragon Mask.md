*<p>This mask of glossy crimson has swept-back horns and spiked cheek ridges. The mask reshapes to fit the face and head of a wearer attuned to it. While you are wearing the mask and attuned to it, you gain the following benefits.

***Damage Absorption.*** You have resistance against fire damage. If you already have resistance to fire damage from another source, you instead have immunity to fire damage. If you already have immunity to fire damage from another source, whenever you are subjected to fire damage, you take none of that damage and regain a number of hit points equal to half the fire damage dealt.

***Draconic Majesty.*** While you are wearing no armor, you can add your Charisma bonus to your Armor Class.

***Dragon Breath.*** If you have a breath weapon that requires rest to recharge, it gains a recharge of 6.

***Dragon Sight.*** You gain [[Darkvision]] out to 60 feet, or to an additional 60 feet if you already have that sense. Once per day, you can gain [[blindsight]] out to 30 feet for 5 minutes.

***Dragon Tongue.*** You can speak and understand Draconic. You also have advantage on any [[/check cha format=long]] you make against red dragons.

***Legendary Resistance (1/Day).*** If you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead.

***Dragon Fire.*** If you deal fire damage to a creature or flammable object, it starts burning. At the start of each of its turns, a creature burning in this way takes 1d6 fire damage. A creature that can reach the burning target can use an action to extinguish the fire.</p>*
