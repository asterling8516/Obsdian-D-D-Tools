*<h5>Coin of Decisionry</h5>
Starting at rank 2, your *coin of decisionry* becomes a common magic item. When you flip the coin, it always lands with the Acquisitions Incorporated sigil face down, and a message appears on the “tails” face. Roll a d4 on the following table to determine the message.

The coin has absolutely no [[divination]] abilities, and its results when you use it are random. But nobody else knows that. When a creature within 10 feet of you flips the coin (after having had its powerful prognostication powers dutifully explained), you can exert your will to control its operation as a bonus action, choosing the result that appears after it lands as a means of gently coercing the user toward a specific course of action. The creature flipping the coin can detect your manipulation with a successful DC 13 Wisdom ([[Insight]]) check.
<h5>Better Odds</h5>
When you reach rank 3, your *coin of decisionry* gains a measure of actual [[divination]] power and becomes an uncommon magic item. In addition to its normal function, you can use an action to flip the *coin of decisionry* twice while pondering a specific plan or objective, noting both random results. If you succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence ([[Arcana]]) check, you learn which of the two results is more applicable to the course of action. This property of the coin can’t be used again until the next dawn.*
