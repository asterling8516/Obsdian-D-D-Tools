*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a humanoid)</i>This circlet is an uncommon magic item called a *<span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif" data-content-chunk-id="5b27413f-877e-4c35-97c5-90f3ea9be9d3">circlet of human perfection</span>*. Only humanoids can attune to it. The circlet transforms its attuned wearer into an attractive human of average height and weight. The circlet chooses the physical characteristics of the form, such as age, gender, skin color, hair color, and voice. Except for size, the wearer’s statistics and racial traits don’t change, nor do items worn or carried by the wearer. Removing the circlet ends the effect.*
