*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a Requires Attunement )</i>This strange metal device that looks like the metallic version of a hounds muzzle seems to be able to sniff out specific creatures using the users spell slots. Each level of spell slot doubles the distance at which it can locate said creature. Though the item seems to be a prototype and haphazardly put together. You are able to cast locate creature effectivly doubling its search radius with every spell level above level 1. This device does not work if there is already a strong scent in the air, the creature is underwater, the creature is polymorphed, or if there is some other condition that would normally affect the sense of smell.*
