*<p>This cloak is a cloak of elvenkind. It also grants you resistance to fire damage while you wear it. It loses its magic if exposed to sunlight for 1 hour without interruption.

While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks made to hide, as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.</p>*
