*<p>While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the ****[[Compendium.world.ddb-eureka-ddb-spells.Item.gVFjEA05bdwsq1R4|detect thoughts]] spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply--using a bonus action to do so--while your focus on it continues.

While focusing on a creature with ******detect thoughts**, you can use an action to cast the ****[[Compendium.world.ddb-eureka-ddb-spells.Item.qpIx0jAcObMuM7TE|suggestion]] spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the ******suggestion** property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>*
