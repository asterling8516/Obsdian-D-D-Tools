*Also at rank 1, you are the beneficiary of a *whisper jar* — a common magic item resembling an ether-filled jar with a long tap hose. The jar is used to record others’ stories and your own observations, like a verbal notebook with unlimited space. The *whisper jar* records as fast as a creature can speak into it, and whispers back words at the same pace they were recorded. Activating the playback of a particular recording is an action.

<h5>Whispered Encyclopedia</h5>
At rank 2, your *whisper jar* becomes an uncommon magic item that can tap into the broader lore of Acquisitions Incorporated. As a bonus action, you ask the jar for information on a specific subject and make a DC 15 Intelligence ([[History]]) check. On a success, the jar plays back a recording on that subject, made somewhere, sometime by another Acq Inc loremonger. This property of the whisper jar can’t be used again until the next dawn.
<h5>Whispered Warnings</h5>
Also at rank 3, your *whisper jar* gains additional power and becomes a rare magic item. As an action, you can cause the jar to function as a wand of enemy detection, whereupon it whispers the direction to foes within range. This property of the *whisper jar* can’t be used again until the next dawn.
<h5>Whispered [[Arcana]]</h5>
Also at rank 4, your *whisper jar* gains access to even more magic. By whispering the name of one of the following spells into the jar as an action, you can cast that spell from the jar: detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, find traps, identify, or locate animals or plants. This property of the *whisper jar* can’t be used again until the next dawn.*
