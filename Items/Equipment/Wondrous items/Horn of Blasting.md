# Horn of Blasting

**Horn of Blasting**
_Trinket_
**Type:** Trinket
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 7000 gp
**Rarity:** Rare
**Attunement:** None

*<p>You can use an action to speak the horn's command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a [[/save con 15 format=long]]. On a failed save, a creature takes  [[/damage 5d6 type=thunder average=true]] damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take  [[/damage 10d6 type=thunder average=true]] damage instead of 5d6.

Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals  [[/damage 10d6 type=fire average=true]] damage to the blower and destroys the horn.</p>*
