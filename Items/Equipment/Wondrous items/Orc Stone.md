# Orc Stone

**Orc Stone**

*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a recipient only)</i><p>I saved the life of an orc, who gave me a stone with the symbol of the Many-Arrows tribe (a humanoid skull pierced by three arrows) carved into it. The stone is an uncommon magic item that requires attunement, and only I can attune to it.

As an action, I can use the stone to summon the spirit of an orc warrior, which appears within 30 feet of me. The spirit uses the orc war chief stat block in the *<a title="Monster Manual" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm">Monster Manual</a>* and disappears after 10 minutes or when reduced to 0 hit points. The spirit understands any language I speak and obeys my commands.

After the stone is used three times, it turns to dust.
