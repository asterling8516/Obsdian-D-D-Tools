**Wheel of Stars**
_Trinket_
**Type:** Trinket
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 40000 gp
**Rarity:** Veryrare
**Attunement:** Requires Attunement

*<p>While attuned to this device, you have a +1 bonus to Wisdom saving throws, and you can use an action to cast the dancing lights, guidance, or message cantrips.

***Portent of the Stars.*** As a reaction when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, you make that creature roll a d10 and add or subtract the number rolled (your choice) from the roll. Once you use this feature of the *wheel of stars*, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

***Alter Gravity.*** As an action, you can cast fly on yourself or you can cast levitate (save DC 15). Once you use this feature of the *wheel of stars*, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

***Part of a Whole.*** While this component is not installed in the Orrery of the Wanderer, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.</p>*
