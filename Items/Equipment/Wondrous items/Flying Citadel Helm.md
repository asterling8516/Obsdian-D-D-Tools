# Flying Citadel Helm

**Flying Citadel Helm**
_Trinket_
**Type:** Trinket
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 30000 gp
**Rarity:** Veryrare
**Attunement:** Requires Attunement

*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a Spellcaster)</i><p>The function of this ornate chair is to propel and maneuver a flying citadel on which it has been installed. The chair has AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It is destroyed if reduced to 0 hit points.

The sensation of being attuned to a *flying citadel helm* is akin to the pins-and-needles effect one experiences after oneâ€™s arm or leg falls asleep, but not as intense.

While attuned to a *flying citadel helm* and sitting in it, you gain the following abilities for as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell):</p>
* You can use the *flying citadel helm* to move the citadel through the air, up to 80 feet per round, or up to 8 miles per hour.
* You can steer the citadel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the way that a rudder or oars can be used to maneuver a seafaring ship.
* At any time, you can see and hear from the highest point outside the citadel as though you were at that location.

<p>If no creature attuned to the helm is maintaining concentration, the citadel remains motionless in its space.

***Transfer Attunement.*** You can use an action or a bonus action to touch a willing spellcaster, whereupon that creature attunes to the *flying citadel helm* immediately, and your attunement to the *flying citadel helm* ends.

***Crash.*** Should the *flying citadel helm* be destroyed, the citadel it is installed on loses power and begins to crumble. If the crumbling citadel is in the air, it descends at a rate of 30 feet per round, or 300 feet per minute. Any creature on the citadel or on the ground within 120 feet of the citadel when it lands must make a [[/save dex 20 format=long]], taking  [[/damage 6d12 type=bludgeoning average=true]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>*
