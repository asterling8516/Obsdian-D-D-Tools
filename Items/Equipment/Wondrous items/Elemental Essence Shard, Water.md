*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a sorcerer)</i><p>This crackling crystal contains the essence of an elemental plane. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can use this property.

**Water.** You create a wave of water that bursts out from you in a 10-foot radius. Each creature of your choice that you can see in that area takes  [[/damage 2d6 type=cold average=true]] damage and must succeed on a [[/save str format=long]] against your spell save DC or be pushed 10 feet away from you and fall prone.</p>*
