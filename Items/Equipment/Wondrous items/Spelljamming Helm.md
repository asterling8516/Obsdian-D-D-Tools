*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a Spellcaster)</i><p>The function of this ornate chair is to propel and maneuver a ship on which it has been installed through space and air. It can also propel and maneuver a ship on water or underwater, provided the ship is built for such travel. The ship in question must weigh 1 ton or more.

The sensation of being attuned to a *spelljamming helm* is akin to the pins-and-needles effect one experiences after one’s arm or leg falls asleep, but not as painful.

While attuned to a *spelljamming helm* and sitting in it, you gain the following abilities for as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell):</p>
* You can use the *spelljamming helm* to move the ship through space, air, or water up to the ship’s speed. If the ship is in space and no other objects weighing 1 ton or more are within 1 mile of it, you can use the *spelljamming helm* to move the vessel fast enough to travel 100 million miles in 24 hours.
* You can steer the vessel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the way that a rudder or oars can be used to maneuver a seafaring ship.
* At any time, you can see and hear what’s happening on and around the vessel as though you were standing in a location of your choice aboard it.

***Transfer Attunement.*** You can use an action to touch a willing spellcaster. That creature attunes to the *spelljamming helm* immediately, and your attunement to it ends.

<p>COST OF A SPELLJAMMING HELM

A *spelljamming helm* propels and steers a ship much as sails, oars, and rudders work on a seafaring vessel, and a *spelljamming helm* is easy to create if one has the proper spell. Create spelljamming helm has a material component cost of 5,000 gp, so that’s the least one can pay to acquire a *spelljamming helm*.

Wildspace merchants, including dohwars and mercanes (both described in *<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sais/bam/">Boo’s Astral Menagerie</a>*), typically sell a *spelljamming helm* for substantially more than it cost to make. How much more depends on the market, but 7,500 gp would be a reasonable demand. A desperate buyer in a seller’s market might pay 10,000 gp or more.</p>
