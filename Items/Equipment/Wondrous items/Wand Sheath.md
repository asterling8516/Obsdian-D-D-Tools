# Wand Sheath

**Wand Sheath**
_Trinket_
**Type:** Trinket
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 20 gp
**Rarity:** Common
**Attunement:** Requires Attunement

*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a Warforged)</i>A *wand sheath* clamps onto your arm and imparts the following benefits:
* The *wand sheath* can't be removed from you while youâ€™re attuned to it.
* You can insert a wand into the sheath as an action. The sheath can hold only one wand at a time.
* You can retract or extend a wand from the sheath as a bonus action. While the wand is extended, you can use it as if you were holding it, but your hand remains free.

If a sheathed wand requires attunement, you must attune to the wand before you can use it. However, the *wand sheath* and the attached wand count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to. If you remove the wand from the sheath, your attunement to the wand ends.*
