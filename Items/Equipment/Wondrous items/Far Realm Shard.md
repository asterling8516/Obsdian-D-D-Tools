# Far Realm Shard

**Far Realm Shard**
_Trinket_
**Type:** Trinket
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 8000 gp
**Rarity:** Rare
**Attunement:** Requires Attunement

*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a sorcerer)</i><p>This writhing crystal is steeped in the warped essence of the Far Realm. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you canÂ cause a slimy tentacle to rip through the fabric of reality and strike one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a [[/save cha format=long]] against your spell save DC or take  [[/damage 3d6 type=psychic average=true]] damage and become frightened of you until the start of your next turn.</p>*
