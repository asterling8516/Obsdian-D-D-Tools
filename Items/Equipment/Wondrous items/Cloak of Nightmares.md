*While you wear this cloak, your face is hard to see as the inside of the hood absorbs all light, including magical light. Shadows bend around you causing the darkness to swallow your body. Anybody parts uncovered by the cloak are unaffected by this and can be seen as normal. While wearing this cloak and having your weapons unequipped you make no sound while in the darkness. Gain a +4 to [[stealth]] ability checks. When you have no weapons equipped gain advantage. This must be stated before the roll is made.*
