**Type:** Trinket
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 40 gp

*When a suit of shiftweave is created, up to five different outfits can be embedded into the cloth. While wearing the clothing, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to transform your outfit into your choice of one of the other designs contained within it. Regardless of its appearance, the outfit can’t be anything but clothing. Although it can duplicate the look of other magical clothing, it doesn’t gain their magical properties.*
