*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a sorcerer)</i><p>This crackling crystal contains the essence of an elemental plane. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.
