*The professor orb owned by Vellynne Harpell and stolen by Nass Lantomir calls itself Professor Skant. It is lawful good, and it has a Wisdom of 11 and a Charisma of 9. It speaks and reads Common, Draconic, Elvish, and Loross (the dead language of the Empire of Netheril). Professor Skant is a chatterbox and assumes all humanoids are dunderheads. When elaborating on its areas of expertise, it adopts an unintentionally patronizing tone. It has the following four areas of expertise:
* The [[history]] of Netheril (see the "<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/idrotf/doom-of-ythryn#sidebarFateOfNetheril">Fate of Netheril</a>" sidebar)
* Vampirism and the traits of vampires
* Rituals surrounding the making, bottling, and drinking of Elverquisst (a rare, ruby-colored elven liquor distilled from sunshine and rare summer fruits)
* The tarrasque (see the *<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/homebrew/creations/magic-items/professor-skant/"https:/www.dndbeyond.com/sources/mm">Monster Manual</a>*)*
