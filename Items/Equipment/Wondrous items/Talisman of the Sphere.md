*When you make an Intelligence ([[Arcana]]) check to control a **sphere of annihilation** while you are holding this talisman, you double your proficiency bonus on the check. In addition, when you start your turn with control over a **sphere of annihilation**, you can use an action to levitate it 10 feet plus a number of additional feet equal to 10 × your Intelligence modifier.*
