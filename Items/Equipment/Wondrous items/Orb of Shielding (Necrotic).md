*<p>An *orb of shielding* is a polished, spherical chunk of crystal or stone aligned to one of the planes of existence. If you're a spellcaster, you can use this orb as a spellcasting focus.

If you're holding the orb when you take damage of the type associated with the orb's material, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d4 (to a minimum of 0). An *orb of necrotic shielding* - also called a *Mabaran obsidian* orb - reduces any necrotic damage you take by 1d4.</p>*
