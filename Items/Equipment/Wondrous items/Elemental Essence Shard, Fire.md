# Elemental Essence Shard, Fire

**Elemental Essence Shard, Fire**
_Trinket_
**Type:** Trinket
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 16000 gp
**Rarity:** Rare
**Attunement:** Requires Attunement

*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a sorcerer)</i><p>This crackling crystal contains the essence of an elemental plane. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can use this property.

**Fire.** One target of the spell that you can see catches fire. The burning target takes  [[/damage 2d10 type=fire average=true]] damage at the start of its next turn, and then the flames go out.</p>*
