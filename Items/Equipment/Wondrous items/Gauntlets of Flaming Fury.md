*While you wear both of these steel gauntlets, any non-magical weapon you grasp with either gauntlet is treated as a magic weapon. As a bonus action, you can use the gauntlets to cause magical flames to envelop one or two melee weapons in your grasp. Each flaming weapon deals an extra  [[/damage 1d6 type=fire average=true]] damage on a hit. The flames last until you sheath or let go of either weapon. Once used, this property canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.*
