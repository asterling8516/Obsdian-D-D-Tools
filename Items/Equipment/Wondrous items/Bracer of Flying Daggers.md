*This armband appears to have thin daggers strapped to it. As an action, you can pull up to two magic daggers from the bracer and immediately hurl them, making a ranged attack with each dagger. A dagger vanishes if you donâ€™t hurl it right away, and the daggers disappear right after they hit or miss. The bracer never runs out of daggers.*
