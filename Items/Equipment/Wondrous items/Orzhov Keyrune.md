*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a member of the relevant guild)</i><p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">**Orzhov Keyrune (Rare).** This keyrune is carved from white marble with veins of black. The end is shaped like a thrull’s head, with a gold faceplate affixed. On command, the keyrune transforms into a winged thrull for up to 2 hours. If you don’t come from an Orzhov oligarch family, it serves you grudgingly, clownishly aping your movements and mannerisms while carrying out your orders.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">When you use an action to speak the item’s command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a winged thrull. If there isn’t enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn’t transform. </p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the disable-webm=1">Dodge action and moves to avoid danger.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can’t transform again until 36 hours have passed.</p>*
