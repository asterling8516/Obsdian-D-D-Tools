*<p>This hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

While the lantern is within 300 feet of any creature of the Fiend type, its flame turns bright green. The lantern doesn’t pinpoint the creature’s exact location, however.</p>*
