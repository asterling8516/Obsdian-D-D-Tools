*<p>This mottled green mask is surmounted by a frilled crest and has leathery spiked plates along its jaw. The mask reshapes to fit the face and head of a wearer attuned to it. While you are wearing the mask and attuned to it, you gain the following benefits.

***Damage Absorption.*** You have resistance against poison damage. If you already have resistance to poison damage from another source, you instead have immunity to poison damage. If you already have immunity to poison damage from another source, whenever you are subjected to poison damage, you take none of that damage and regain a number of hit points equal to half the poison damage dealt.

***Draconic Majesty.*** While you are wearing no armor, you can add your Charisma bonus to your Armor Class.

***Dragon Breath.*** If you have a breath weapon that requires rest to recharge, it gains a recharge of 6.

***Dragon Sight.*** You gain [[Darkvision]] out to 60 feet, or to an additional 60 feet if you already have that sense. Once per day, you can gain [[blindsight]] out to 30 feet for 5 minutes.

***Dragon Tongue.*** You can speak and understand Draconic. You also have advantage on any [[/check cha format=long]] you make against green dragons.

***Legendary Resistance (1/Day).*** If you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead.

***Water Breathing.*** You can breathe underwater.</p>*
