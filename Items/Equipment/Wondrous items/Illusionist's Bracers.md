*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a spellcaster)</i><p>A powerful illusionist of House Dimir originally developed these bracers, which enabled her to create multiple minor illusions at once. The bracersâ€™ power, though, extends far beyond illusions.

While wearing the bracers, whenever you cast a cantrip, you can use a bonus action on the same turn to cast that cantrip a second time.</p>*
