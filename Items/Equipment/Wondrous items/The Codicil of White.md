*<p>*The Codicil of White* is a tall, thin volume bound in white ermine fur over seasoned boards of white pine and sealed with a clasp and lock of tarnished silver. The book is cold to the touch, and the fur is worn about the edges from use. The twenty-seven pages within are of vellum painted with silver gilt on the outer edges. The whole is sewn to a leather binding with strips of sinews, making it quite durable.

A creature with the codicil in its possession has resistance to cold damage.

The codicil was written by followers of Auril as a primer on her worship. The first page is a title page with the snowflake symbol of Auril on it. The remaining pages describe various priestly rituals and ceremonies in chilling detail. Nestled among these descriptions is a spell that wizards can learn (frost fingers), and a poem called “Rime of the Frostmaiden” (see <a title="appendix E" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/IDRotF/appendix-e-rime-of-the-frostmaiden">appendix E</a>). The poem is an incantation, the power of which can be used to split a glacier (see <a title="chapter 6" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/IDRotF/caves-of-hunger">chapter 6</a>). The poem might have other capabilities, at your discretion.</p>*
