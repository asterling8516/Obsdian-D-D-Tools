**Type:** Trinket
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 3000 gp

*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a sorcerer)</i><p>This flickering crystal holds the essence of an Outer Plane. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can use this property.

**Chaotic.** Choose one creature who takes damage from the spell. That target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks made before the start of your next turn.</p>*
