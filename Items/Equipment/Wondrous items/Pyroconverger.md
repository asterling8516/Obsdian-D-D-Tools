*<p>A* Pyroconverger* is an Izzet-made flamethrower. It carries a risk of malfunction each time you use it.

As an action, you can cause the *Pyroconverger* to project fire in a 10-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a [[/save dex 13 format=long]], taking  [[/damage 4d6 type=fire average=true]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Each time you use the *Pyroconverger*, roll a d10 and add the number of times you have used it since your last long rest. If the total is 11 or higher, the *Pyroconverger* malfunctions: you take  [[/damage 4d6 type=fire average=true]] damage, and you canâ€™t use the *Pyroconverger* again until you finish a long rest.</p>*
