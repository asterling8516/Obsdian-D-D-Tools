*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a sorcerer)</i><p>This flickering crystal holds the essence of an Outer Plane. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can use this property.

**Evil.** Choose one creature who takes damage from the spell. That target takes an extra  [[/damage 3d6 type=necrotic average=true]] damage.</p>*
