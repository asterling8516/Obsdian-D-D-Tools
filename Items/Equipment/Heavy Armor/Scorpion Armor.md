*This suit of plate armor is fashioned from giant scorpion chitin. While wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits:
* The armor improves your combat readiness, granting you a +5 bonus to initiative as long as you aren’t incapacitated.
* The armor doesn’t impose disadvantage on your Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks.
* The armor doesn’t impose disadvantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of extreme heat (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#ExtremeHeat">chapter 5</a> of the *<a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>*).

***Curse.*** This armor is cursed. Whenever you don or doff it, you must make a [[/save con 15 format=long]], taking  [[/damage 10d10 + 45 type=poison average=true]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Only a wish spell can remove the armor’s curse.*
