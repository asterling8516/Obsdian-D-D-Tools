*<p>While wearing this armor, you have resistance to piercing damage.

**Curse.** This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an **identify**Â spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the [[Compendium.world.ddb-eureka-ddb-spells.Item.nPQBghExGeyvDe3g|remove curse]] spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have vulnerability to bludgeoning and slashing damage.</p>*
