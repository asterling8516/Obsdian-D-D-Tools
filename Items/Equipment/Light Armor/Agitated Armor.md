*<p>While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal. When standing in the shadows they darken around you (eg. Light shadows become dark, dark become darker) at night you are barely visible. While hiding in shadows you gain advantage on [[stealth]] roles and during the night. 

**Curse.** Once you don this cursed armor, you can't doff it unless you are targeted by the **remove curse** spell or similar magic must be cast using a 3rd level spell slot. While wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on saving throws against their spells and special abilities. Once **remove curse** spell is used all traits revert to that of normal armor no longer grating any buffs. </p>*
