*<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">This ring, adorned with the symbol of Rakdos, allows you to cast hellish rebuke. A <span class="Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif">guild signet</span> is sometimes awarded to a guild member whose renown score in that guild is 5 or higher, as a reward for performing special services for the guild. Aside from its magical properties, the ring is also an indicator of Rakdos’ recognition and favor.</p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">A signet has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you can expend 1 charge to cast the associated spell (save DC 13).</p>*
