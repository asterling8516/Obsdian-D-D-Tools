*<p>This outfit consists of a heavy fur coat or cloak over layers of wool clothing, as well as a fur-lined hat or hood, goggles, and fur-lined leather boots and gloves.

As long as cold weather clothing remains dry, its wearer automatically succeeds on saving throws against the effects of extreme cold (see “<a href="https://dndbeyond.com/sources/idrotf/welcome-to-the-far-north/#ExtremeCold">Extreme Cold</a>”).</p>*
