*<p>While wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to AC, when attacked and you can see the attacker roll a d4 and add that to your AC. This is rerolled before every attack directed at you. Due to the demonic [[nature]] of this armor, the shadows welcome you with open arms. When rolling for [[stealth]] add 1d6 on top of your d20 and modifier. 

**Curse.** Once you don this cursed armor, you can't doff it unless you are targeted by the **remove curse** spell or similar magic. If forcibly removed or taken off without using the spell you take  [[/damage 10d10 + 45 type=poison average=true]] damage. </p>*
