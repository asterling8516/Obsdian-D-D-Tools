*<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and create orchestral music by waving it around. The music can be heard out to a range of 60 feet and ends when you stop waving<span class="No-Break"> the wand.</span></p>
<p class="Core-Styles_Core-Body">The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, a sad tuba sound plays as the wand crumbles to dust and is <span class="No-Break">destroyed.</span></p>*
