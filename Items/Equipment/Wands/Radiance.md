**Radiance**
_Wand_
**Type:** Wand

**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** N/A

*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a Spellcaster)</i><p>While holding this wand, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls. In addition, you ignore half cover when making a spell attack. *Radiance* is in the form of an exquisite golden hand mirror.

While surrounded by darkness, it sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. A creature that is attuned to *Radiance* can use a bonus action while holding the mirror to cast the *enhance ability* spell, choosing itself and no other creature as the spell’s target. Once this property of the wand is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>*
