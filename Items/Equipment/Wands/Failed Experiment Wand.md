# Failed Experiment Wand

**Failed Experiment Wand**
_Wand_
**Type:** Wand
**Quantity:** 1
**Weight:** N/A
**Price:** 11000 gp
**Rarity:** Rare
**Attunement:** Requires Attunement

*<div class="item-attunement"><i>(Requires attunement by a Spellcaster)</i><p>While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast either a green-flamed fireball or a blue lightning bolt at random from it (save DC 15).

For 1 charge, you cast the 3rd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.

This wand has 2 charges per day. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.</p>*
