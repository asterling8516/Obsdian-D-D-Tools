Fishing is a popular pastime in Wildspace and the Astral Sea, though this activity isn’t possible aboard a ship that is moving faster than its flying speed. At the end of each hour spent fishing, a character can make a DC 15 Wisdom ([[Survival]]) check. A failed check indicates no fish is caught during that hour. On a successful check, roll a d10 and consult the Fishing table to determine the catch.</p>
