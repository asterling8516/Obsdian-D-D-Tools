When a character is subject to petrification and must make a save, they instead must make 2 saves.
If they fail the first save, they are slowed as per the spell [[General D&D/Spells/3rd Level/Slow]]

If the character passes their second save they shake off the effects and may act normally.
If the character fails the second save they are petrified as per the regular [[Petrified]] rules.
