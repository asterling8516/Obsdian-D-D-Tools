*Each drink consumed in a drinking contest prompts a constitution save. The DC for this save begins at DC 5 and increases by 1 for each drink consumed (The DM may wish to increase the DC by more than 1 for particularly strong drinks).*
*There are 5 stages of drunkenness. Failing a Con save advances the player to the next stage.*

*For the purposes of racial saves, alcohol is considered a poison.*

**Stage 1:** Sober - no penalties
**Stage 2:** Tipsy - no penalties
**Stage 3:** Drunk - Disadvantage on any INT or WIS based skills/checks/saves
**Stage 4:** Queasy - Disadvantage on any CON based skills/checks/saves
**Stage 5:** Puke/Pass Out - Disadvantage on all checks. If a save is missed by 5 or more, the competitor passes out. 

Competitors may surrender the contest whenever they wish, though most will surrender if they are Queasy and they believe the other isnâ€™t. Deception and/or Intimidate checks can help influence the way a match plays out
