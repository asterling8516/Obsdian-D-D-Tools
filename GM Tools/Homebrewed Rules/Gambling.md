## Twentybone
*Originating in the back alleys of major cities, twentybone has become a popular vice for many with coin to spare.*

**The Equipment:** A selection of d20, a dealer, and a "dice girl or guy".

**The Mechanics:** On each round, players can buy any number of d20s they want. The standard peasant’s-wage cost for a d20 is a copper piece, though at some tables a player can spend a silver piece, a gold piece, a platinum piece, or even more for a die. When all dice have been purchased, the players all roll their dice. Then the house rolls a die. Every player die that beats the house die gets paid off with two coins for every one coin it was bought for. For the player, a 1 always loses, and a 20 always wins. 

**The Odds:** The player has a 47.75 percent chance of winning. 1’s don’t beat anything, 2’s only beat house 1’s, 3’s beat house 1’s and 2’s, and so on. The exception is player 20’s, which have a special advantage of beating house 20’s.

**The Payout:** The player will win 9.55 coins for every 10 coins he bets. The fact that a player is paid two coins on every win obscures the fact that the player gave over a coin to buy the die. Accounting for this, every successful bet’s payout is 1-to-1.

## GYP
*Say your prayer to the God of Luck and roll your dice!*

**The Equipment:** 2-3d6's

**The Mechanics:** Each round, players roll 2d6. The minimum buy in is typically 5gp, though higher stakes tables aren't uncommon. If the player rolls a 7 or 12 on 2d6 they win. A player can double their bet to add another 1d6 after rolling.

**The Odds:** The player has a 19.45 percent chance of winning.

**The Payout:** The player has a 19.45 percent chance of winning.


## Whore's Dice

*A popular game among the escort class, who often play with their clients.* 

**The Equipment:**  A single d6.


**The Mechanics:** The player rolls 1d6 while the dealer rolls 3d6. If the result of the player's dice match the result on any of the dealer's dice, the player wins. 


**The Odds:** 
The player has a 16.67 percent chance of winning with one dice. 
The player has a 2.78 percent chance of winning with two dice. 
The player has a 0.46 percent chance of winning with three dice. 


**The Payout:** 
If one die matches the player's number, they get their money back.
if two dice match the player's number, they get double their bet.
If three dice match the player's number, they triple their bet.

## Last Man Standing
*Go toe-to-toe with your fellow players in battle to the death.*

**The Equipment:** 1d20, 1d12, 1d10, 1d8, 1d6, and 1d4 per player.

**The Mechanics:** Each round, players roll their largest dic (d20 then d12 and so on). Anyone with the same result is out. Players continue to roll until they are all out or only one remains.

**The Payout:** Each player puts an amount in the pot to play. The winner wins 75% of the pot (House takes the remaining 25%).

If no one wins, the pot carries over into the next game
