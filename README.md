Streamlined D&D Content for Obsidian
This repository provides a collection of Dungeons & Dragons spell and item descriptions, meticulously formatted for optimal use within Obsidian.md vaults. These files have been processed to remove extraneous data, leaving behind clean, readable Markdown that's perfect for quick reference during your campaigns.

✨ Features
Clean & Readable Format: Spell and item descriptions are presented in a streamlined, plaintext-like Markdown format, making them easy to read and integrate into your notes.

Essential Information: Each file contains key details such as casting time, range, components, damage/effect, weight, price, rarity, and attunement, presented consistently.

No Clutter: Images and deeply nested YAML data from the original import have been removed to focus on the core information.

Obsidian-Friendly: Designed to seamlessly fit into any Obsidian vault for quick lookup and linking.

Automatic Formatting: Original [[/check ...]] syntax has been converted to human-readable "DC X Ability Save" format.
